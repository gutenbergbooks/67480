<div><h1 class='nobreak'><a id='wire'></a>THE WIRE SUSPENSION BRIDGE.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>This elegant structure is thrown across the
Schuylkill, on the site once occupied by an airy and
graceful wooden erection, for years the pride of our
city, and celebrated as being the longest bridge of a
single arch in the known world. The boldness of
the architect in thus spanning a river three hundred
and fifty feet wide, was the theme of universal admiration.
Few will forget Fanny Kemble’s poetic
comparison, when she said the bridge looked like a
white scarf flung across the water. The destruction
of this favorite fabric, by fire, in the fall of 1838,
was regarded as an irreparable loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conflagration presented a grand picture. The
flames were first seen towards the western entrance
of the bridge, and in a very few minutes the whole
fabric was a mass of fire. The wind was down the
stream, and catching the flames as they broke from
the flooring of the bridge, it swept them far away
under, until a fiery cataract, reaching from shore to
shore, seemed pouring horizontally down the river.
By this time spectators began to throng around, and
before the bridge fell, thousands lined the adjacent
shores and covered the side of the overhanging hill,
looking down on the scene below, as from the seats
in an amphitheatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This splendid sight continued for some time, the
gazers looking on in a rapt silence, until suddenly a
low murmur, followed by an involuntary shiver, ran
through the crowd, as the bridge, with a graceful
curtesy, descended a few feet, hesitated, and then,
with a gentle, swan-like motion, sank, like a dream,
down on the waters. But the moment the fabric
touched the wave, a simmering, hissing sound was
heard, while ten thousand sparkles shot up into the
air and sailed away to leeward. The fire still, however,
burned fiercely in the upper works, which had
not reached the water; while volumes of smoke
rolled down the river, blending the earth, the wave,
and the sky into one dark, indistinct mass, so that
the burning timbers, occasionally detached from the
bridge, and borne along by the current, seemed,
almost without the aid of fancy, to be lurid stars
floating through the firmament. The moon, which
was just rising, and which occasionally burst through
the dense veil of smoke, appeared almost side by
side with these wild meteors, and added to the illusion.
The effect was picturesque; at times even
sublime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than two years elapsed before the bridge
was replaced by the present elegant structure, whose
airiness and grace more than reconcile us to the loss
of its predecessor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This new fabric is, we believe, the finest, if not
the only, specimen of its kind in the United States.
The plan is simple. Two square towers of solid
granite, thirty-two feet in height, are built on either
abutment. Over each of these towers, on iron rollers,
pass five wire cables, each cable being composed of
two hundred and sixty strands, each strand being an
eighth or an inch thick. The length of each cable is
six hundred and fifty feet. These cables are secured,
on each shore, in pits, distant from the towers one
hundred feet, and continuing under ground fifty feet
further, to a point where they are securely fastened
at the depth of thirty feet. These pits are built over
so as to exclude the rain, but not the air; and the
cables, being painted, are thus preserved from rust.
The cables, in stretching from tower to tower, form
a curve, the lowest point of which is at the centre
of the bridge. The causeway is of wood, and
hangs, by smaller wire cables, from these larger
ones. The width of the bridge is twenty-seven feet,
and its length, from abutment to abutment, three
hundred and forty-three feet. The strength of the
bridge has been tested by a weight of seventy tons.
The structure is painted white throughout, and has
already won the name of the most graceful bridge in
the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What glorious times, Oliver, the old Turks must
have, sitting, on a sultry day like this, listening to
the cool plashing of their fountains, and smoking
their chiboques—egad!—until they fall asleep, and
dream of dark-eyed Houris smiling on them, amid
the fragrant groves and by the cool rivers of a Musselman
Paradise. What a pity we were not born
in Turkey, you a Bashaw of three tails, and I the
Sultaun of Stamboul! How we would have stroked
our beards—and smoked our pipes—and given praise
to the prophet as we drank our sherbert, spiced, you
know, with a <span class='it'>very</span> little of the <span class='it'>aqua vitæ</span>, that comfort
of comforts to the inner man! We could then
have dressed like gentlemen, and not gone about,
as we do now, breeched, coated, and swaddled in
broadcloth, like a couple of Egyptian mummies.
Just imagine yourself in a dashing Turkish dress,
with a turban on your head, and a scimitar all studded
with diamonds at your side, with which—the
scimitar I mean—you are wont to slice off the heads
of infidels as I slice off the top of this pyramid
of ice-cream—help yourself, for it’s delicious! I
think I see us now, charging at the head of our
spahis against the rascally Russians, driving their
half starved soldier slaves like chaff before a whirl-wind,
and carrying our horse-tails and shouting
“Il Allah!” into the very tents of their chieftains.
What magnificent fellows we would have made!
Ah!—my dear boy—you and I are out of our element.
Take my word for it, a Turk is your finest
gentleman, your true philosopher, the only man that
understands how to live. He keeps better horses,
wears richer clothes, walks with a nobler mien,
smokes more luxuriously, drinks more seductive
coffee, and kisses his wife or ladye-love with better
grace, than any man or set of men, except you and
I, “under the broad canopy of heaven” as the town-meeting
orators have it. And let me tell you this
last accomplishment—this kissing gracefully, “<span class='it'>secundum artem</span>”—is
a point of education most impiously
neglected amongst us. Kissing is a science
by itself. Let us draw up to the window where we
can drink in the perfume of the garden, and while
you whiff away at your meerschaum, I will prove
the truth of my assertion. One has a knack for
talking after dinner—I suppose it is because good
steaks and madeira lubricate the tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are born to kiss and be kissed. It comes natural
to us, as marriage does to a woman. Why,
sir, I can remember kissing the female babies when
I was yet in my cradle, and my friend Sir Thomas
Lawrence did himself the honor to paint me at my
favorite pursuit, as you know by that exquisite picture
in my library. The very first day I went to
school I kissed all the sweet little angels there. I
wasn’t fairly out of my alphabet, when I used to
wait behind a pump, for my sweetheart to come out
of school, and as soon as I saw her I made a point
of kissing her just to see how prettily she blushed.
As I grew older I loved to steal in, some summer
evening, on her, and kiss her asleep on the sofa—or,
if she was awake, and the old folks were by, I’d
wait till they both got nodding, and then kiss her all
the sweeter for the slyness of the thing. Ah! such
stolen draughts are delicious. I wouldn’t give a sous
to kiss a girl in company, and I always hated Copenhagen,
Pawns, and your other kissing plays, as I
hope I hate the devil. They had a shocking custom
when I was young, that everybody at a wedding
should kiss the bride, just as they all drank, in the
same free and easy way, out of the one big china
punch-bowl; but the practice always hurt my sensibilities,
and I avoided weddings as I would avoid a
ghost, a bailiff, or any other fright. No—no—get
your little charmer up into a corner by yourselves—watch
when everybody’s back is turned—then slip
your arm around her waist, and kiss her with a long
sweet kiss, as if you were a bee sucking honey from
a flower. Nor can one kiss every girl. I’d as lief
take ipecacuanha as kiss some of your sharp-chinned,
icicle-mouthed, lignum-vitæ-faced spinsters—why
one couldn’t get the taste of the bitters out of
his mouth for a week! I go in for your rosy, pouting
lips, that seem to challenge everybody so saucily—egad!
when we kiss such at our leisure, we think
we’re in a seventh heaven. I once lived on such a
kiss for forty-eight hours, for it took the taste for
commoner food out of my mouth “intirely,” as poor
Power used to say. Oh! how I loved the wide,
dark entries one finds in old mansions, where one
could catch these saucy little fairies, and, before
they were well aware of your presence, kiss them
so deliciously. There’s kissing for you! Or, to go
upon a sleigh ride, and when all, save you and your
partner, are busy chatting—while the merry ringing
of the bells and the whizzing motion of the
vehicle cause your spirits to dance for very joy—to
make believe that you wish to arrange the buffalo,
or pull her shawl up closer around her, and then
slyly stealing your face into her bonnet to kiss her
for an instant of ecstasy, while she blushes to the
very temples, lest others may catch you at your
sport. And then, on a summer eve, to row out upon
the bosom of a moonlit lake, and while one of the
ladies sings and all the rest listen, to snatch a chance
and laughingly kiss the pretty girl at your side, all
unnoticed except by her. Or to sit beside a charmer
on a sofa, before a cozy fire on a bitter winter night,
and fill up the pauses of the conversation, you know,
by drawing her to you and kissing her. But more
than all,—when you have won a blushing confession
of love from her you have long and tremblingly
worshipped with all a boy’s devotion,—is the rapture
of the kiss which you press holily to her brow, while
her warm heart flutters against your side, and every
pulse in your body thrills with an ecstasy that has no
rival in after life. Ah! sir, that kiss is <span class='sc'>The Kiss</span>.
It is worth all the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next to being born a Turk I should choose to have
been born an Englishman in the days of Harry the
Eighth. Do you remember how Erasmus tells us,
in one of his letters, that all the pretty women in
London ran up to him and kissed him whenever they
met? That’s what I call being in clover. I don’t
wonder people long for the good old times, for, if all
their fashions were like this, commend me to the
days of the bluff monarch, when</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you ever attend a children’s party, and see
the little dears play Copenhagen? The boys seem
to have an instinctive knack at kissing their partners,
who always show the same modest repugnance—for
modesty is inborn in every woman—aye! and
flings a glory about her like the halo around a Madonna’s
head. The very instant one of the young
scapegraces gets into the ring, he looks slyly all
around it, and there be sure is one little face that
blushes scarlet, and one little heart that beats faster,
for well the owner knows that she is in peril. How
fast her hands slide to and fro along the rope, and
directly the imprisoned youngster makes a dash at
her hand, and, missing it, turns away amid the uproarious
laughter and clapping of hands of the rest,
and essays perchance a feint to tap some other little
hand, all the while, however, keeping one corner of
his eye fixed on the blushing damsel who has foiled
him. And lo! all at once—like an eagle shooting
from the skies—he darts upon it. And now begins
the struggle. What a shouting—and merry laughing—what
cries of encouragement from the lookers
on—what a diving under the rope, and over the rope,
and among the chairs, mingled with whoopings from
the boys, ensues, until the victim has escaped, or
else been caught by her pursuer. Sometimes she
submits quietly to the forfeit, but at other times she
will fight like a young tiger. Then, indeed, comes
“the tug of war.” If she covers her face in her
hands, and is a sturdy little piece beside, young Master
Harry will have to give up the game, and be the
laughing stock of the boys, or else set all chivalry at
defiance and tear away those pretty hands by force.
Many a time, you old curmudgeon, have I laughed
until the tears ran out of my eyes to see a young
scoundrel, scarcely breeched, kissing an unwilling
favorite. How sturdily he sticks up to her, one hand
around her neck, and the other, perhaps, fast hold of
her chin; while she, with face averted, and a frown
upon her tiny brow, is all the while pushing him desperately
away. But the young rascal knows that he
is the strongest, and with him might makes right.
With eagerness in every line of his face, he slips
his arm around her waist, and, after sundry repulses,
wins the kiss at last. And then what a mighty gentleman
he thinks he is! In just such a scene has my
old friend Lawrence taken me off, in that picture, of
<span class='sc'>The Proffered Kiss</span>, in my library, egad!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a great grief to me that so few understand
how to kiss gracefully. Kissing is an accomplishment,
I may be allowed to remark, that should form
a part of every gentleman’s education. A man that
is too bashful to kiss a lady when all is agreeable,
as Mrs. Malaprop would say, is a poor good-for-nought,
a lost sinner, without hope of mercy! He
will never have the courage to pop the question—mark
my words—and will remain a bachelor to his
dying day, unless some lady kindly takes him in
hand and asks him to have her, as my friend Mrs.
Desperate did. The women have a sly way of doing
these things, even if, like a spinster I once knew,
they have to ask a man flatly whether his intentions
are serious or not; and they are very apt to do this
as soon as the kissing becomes a business on your
part. But to return to the <span class='it'>modus operandi</span> of a kiss.
Delicacy in this intellectual amusement is the chief
thing. Don’t—by the bones of Johannes Secundus!—don’t
bungle the matter by a five minutes torture,
like a cat playing with a mouse. Kiss a girl deliberately,
sir—sensible all the time of the great duty
you are performing—but remember also that a kiss,
to be enjoyed in its full flavor, should be taken fresh,
like champaigne just from the flask. Ah! then you
get it in all its airy and <span class='it'>spirituelle</span> raciness. If you
wish a sentimental kiss—and after all they are perhaps
the spicier—steal your arm around her waist,
take her hand softly in your own, and then, tenderly
drawing her towards you, kiss her as you might
imagine a zephyr to do it! I never exactly timed
the manœuvre with a stop-watch, but I’ve no doubt
the affair might be managed very handsomely in ten
seconds. The exact point where a lady should be
kissed may be determined by the intersection of two
imaginary lines, one drawn perpendicularly down
the centre of the face, and the other passing at right
angles through the line of the mouth. Two such
old codgers as you and I may talk of these things
without indiscretion; and, it is but doing our duty by
the world, to give others the benefits of our experience.
Some of these days, when I get leisure, I
shall write a book called “<span class='sc'>Kissing Made Easy</span>.”
The title—don’t you think?—will make it sell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kissing, however, has its evils, for the world, you
know, is made up of sweet and sour. One often gets
into a way of kissing a pretty girl by way of a flirtation,
and ends by tumbling head over ears into love
with her. This is taking the disease in its most
virulent form; but—thank the stars!—it is most apt
to attend on cases where the gentleman has not been
used to kissing. I would recommend, as a general
rule, that every one should be inoculated to the matter,
for, depend upon it, this is the only way to save
them from a desperate and perhaps fatal attack. I
once knew a fine fellow—talented, rich, in a profession—whose
only fault, indeed, was that he had
never kissed anybody but his sister. He had the
most holy horror of a man who could so insult the
dignity of the sex as to kiss a lady—and, I verily believe,
the sight of such a thing, in his younger days,
would have thrown him into a fit. At length he fell
in love; and as sweet a creature was Blanche Merrion
as ever trod greensward, or sang from very
gaiety of heart on the morning air. Day after day
her lover watched her from afar, as a worshipper
would watch the countenance of a saint; but months
passed by and still he dared not lift his eyes to her
face, when her own were shining on him from their
calm, holy depths. Other suitors appeared, and if
Blanche had fancied them, she would have been lost
forever to Howard, through his own timidity; but
happily none of them touched her heart, and she
went on her way “in maiden meditation fancy free.”
Often, in her own gay style of raillery, would she
torment poor Howard about his bashfulness; and
during these moments, I verily believe, he would
gladly have exchanged his situation for that of any
heretic that ever roasted in an inquisitorial fire. A
twelvemonth passed by, and yet Howard could not
muster courage to express his devotion, and if, perchance,
his eyes sometimes revealed his tale, the
confession faded from them as soon as the liquid ones
of Blanche were turned upon him. If ever one suffered,
he suffered from his love. He worshipped his
divinity in awe-struck humility, scarcely deeming
she would deign to see his adoration. He might
have said with Helena,</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length a friend of Howard asked him to wait
on him as a groomsman, and who should be his
partner but Blanche! Now, of all places for kissing,
commend me to a wedding. The groom kisses
the bride—and the groomsmen kiss the bridemaids—and
each one of the company kisses his partner, or
if any one is destitute of the article he makes a
dumb show of kissing somebody behind the door.
But the groomsmen have the cream of the business,
for it’s one of the perquisites of their office that
they should kiss their partners, as a sort of recompense
for shawling them, and chaperoning them, and
paying them those thousand little attentions which
are so exquisite to a lady, and which a gentleman
can only pay, especially if the lady is grateful, at
some peril to his peace of mind. Ah! sir, a bridemaid
is a bachelor’s worst foe—one plays with edge
tools when he waits at a wedding—and though you
may dance with an angel or flirt with a Houri, I’d
never—heaven bless you—recommend you to wait
on a girl unless you were ready to marry. Seeing
other folks married is infectious, and, before you
know it, you’ll find yourself engaged. It was a
lucky chance for Howard when he was asked to
wait on Blanche, for I would stake my life that
nothing else could have cured him of his bashfulness.
Nor even then would he have succeeded but for an
accident. One lovely afternoon—it was a country
wedding—he happened to pass by a little sort of
summer-house in a secluded spot in the grounds attached
to the mansion, and who should he see within
but Blanche, asleep on a garden sofa. I wish I could
paint her to you as she then appeared. One arm
was thrown negligently back over her head, while
the other fell towards the floor, holding the book she
had been reading. Her long, soft eye-lashes were
drooped on her cheek. Her golden curls fell, like a
shower of sunbeams scattered through the forest
leaves on a secluded stream, around her brow and
down her neck; and one fair tress, stealing across
her face and nestling in her bosom, waved in her
breath, and rose and fell with the gentle heaving of
that spotless bust. A slight color was on her cheek,
and her lips were parted in a smile, the smallest
space imaginable disclosing the pure teeth beneath,
seeming like a line of pearl set betwixt rubies, or a
speck of snow within a budding rose. Howard
would have retreated, but he could not, and so he
stood gazing on her entranced, until, forgetting
everything in that sight, he stole towards her, and
falling on his knees, hung a moment enraptured over
her. As he thus knelt, his eyes glanced an instant
on the book. It was the poems of Campbell, and
open at a passage which he had the evening before
commended. Blanche had pencilled one verse which
he had declared especially beautiful. His heart
leapt into his mouth. His eyes stole again to that
lovely countenance, and instinctively he bent down
and pressed his lips softly to those of Blanche.
Slight, however, as was the kiss, it broke her slumber,
and she started up; but when her eyes met
those of Howard the crimson blood rushed over her
face, and brow, and down even to her bosom, while
the lover stood, even more abashed, rooted to the
spot. Poor fellow! He would have given the world
if he could have recalled that moment’s indiscretion.
He stammered out something for an apology, he
knew not what, yet without daring to lift his eyes to
her face. She made no reply. A minute of silence
passed. Could he have offended past forgiveness?
He was desperate with agony and terror at the
thought—and, in that very desperation, resolved to
face the worst, and looked up. The bosom of
Blanche heaved violently, her eyes were downcast,
her cheek was changing from pale to red and from
red to pale. All her usual gaiety had disappeared,
and she stood embarrassed and confused, yet without
any marks of displeasure, such as the lover had
looked for, on her countenance. A sudden light
flashed on him, a sudden boldness took possession
of him. He lifted the hand of Blanche—that tiny
hand which now trembled in his grasp—and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blanche! dear Blanche! if you forgive me, be
still more merciful, and give me a right to offend
thus again. I love you, oh! how deeply and fervently!—I
have loved you with an untiring devotion
for years. Will you, dearest, be mine?” and in a
torrent of burning eloquence—for the long pent-up
emotions of years had now found vent—he poured
forth the whole history of his love, its doubts and
fears, its sensitiveness, its adoration, its final hope.
And did Blanche turn away? No—you needn’t smile
so meaningly, you old villain—she sank sobbing on
her lover’s shoulder, who, when at length she was
soothed, was as good as his word, and sinned by a
second kiss. It turned out that Blanche had loved
him all along, and it was only his bashfulness that
had blinded him, else by a thousand little tokens he
might have seen what, in other ways, it would have
been unmaidenly for her to reveal. Now, sir, months
of mutual sorrow might have been saved to both
Blanche and her lover, if he had only possessed a
little more assurance—he would have possessed that
assurance if he had been less finical—if he had been
less finical he would not have been shocked at kissing
a pretty girl. Isn’t that demonstrated like a problem
in the sixth book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I might multiply instances, egad, for fifty years of
experience <span class='it'>will</span> store one’s memory with facts, and
by the aid of them I could reel off arguments for this
accomplishment faster than a rocket whizzes into
the sky. <span class='it'>Kissing</span>, sir—but there goes the supper bell,
and I see your meerschaum’s out. We will rejoin
the ladies, and after taking our Mocha, set the young
folks to dancing, while you and I accompany them
on the shovel and tongs!—Ta-ra-la-ra!</p>

<p class='line0'>There’s a wide ring round the moon,</p>

<p class='line0'>Thine eyes closed smoothly and a wreath</p>

<p class='line0'>I cannot flee thee, Marian,</p>
<p class='line0'>I cannot turn away,</p>
<p class='line0'>Mine eyes must see thee, Marian,</p>
<p class='line0'>Through salt tears night and day.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>ELLEN NEVILLE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>When I recovered my senses, after the events narrated
in the last chapter, I found that I was lying in
the cabin of the schooner on board which I had been
serving, while a group composed of the three surgeons
and several officers of the expedition stood
around me. As I opened my eyes and glanced
around, scarce conscious as yet of the objects that
met my gaze, one of the medical men bent over me
and said that my safety depended on my quiet.
Gradually I imbibed the full meaning of his words,
and called to mind the events immediately preceding
my fall; but, in spite of his charge, I felt an uncontrollable
desire to learn the extent of my injury.
In a low whisper—so low indeed that I was startled
at its faintness—I asked if I was seriously wounded
and whether we had conquered. But he smiled as
he replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, at least not in full, for your weakness
forbids it. But the danger is over. The ball has
been extracted. Quiet is all you now require.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” said I again, “how of our expedition?
Have we conquered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have, but not a word more now. To-morrow
you shall hear all. Gentlemen,” he continued, turning
to the group, “we had best withdraw now that
our friend is past the crisis. He needs repose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt the wisdom of this advice, for my brain was
already whirling from the attempt to control my
thoughts, even for the mere purpose of asking the
questions necessary to satisfy my curiosity; so
when the group left the cabin I sank back on my
couch, and closing my eyes with a sense of relief,
soon lost all recollection in a deep sleep, the effect,
no doubt, of the opiate which had been administered
to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I awoke, the morning breeze was blowing
freshly through the cabin, bringing with it the odors
of thousands of aromatic plants from the shores of
the neighboring islands, and as it wantoned across
my forehead, dallying with my hair and imparting a
delicious coolness to the skin, I felt an invigorating,
pleasurable sensation—a sensation of the most exquisite
delight—such as no one can imagine who has
not felt the cool breath of morning after an illness
in the close cabin of a small schooner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My curiosity to hear the events of the combat
that occurred after my fall, would not suffer me to
rest, and I gave my attendants no peace until I had
learnt the whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be recollected that when I sank to the deck
in a state of insensibility, we were engaged in a
warm contest with the piratical hulk which had been
moored across the mouth of the outlet from the
lagoon. The fight was maintained for some time
on board of the enemy, and at first with varying
success; but the daring of our men at last overcame
the desperate resistance of the pirates, and the enemy
were either driven below, cut down, or forced overboard.
This outwork, as it were, having thus been
carried, we pushed on to the settlement itself, for the
other vessels moored in the lagoon were by this time
deserted, the pirates having retreated to a fortification
on the shore, where their whole force could act
together, and where they had entrenched themselves,
as they vainly imagined, in an impregnable
position. But our brave fellows were not intimidated.
Flushed with success, and burning to revenge
those of their comrades who had already
fallen, they cried out to be led against the desperadoes.
Accordingly, under cover of the guns of our
little fleet, the men were landed, and, while a brisk
fire was kept up from the vessels, the assault was
made. At first the pirates stood manfully to their
posts, pouring in a deadly and unremitting fire on
the assailants. In vain did the officers lead on their
men three several times to the assault, for three
several times were they driven back by the rattling
fire of the now desperate pirates. To increase the
peril of their situation, no sign of their companions
in the rear had as yet appeared. The ruffians were
already cheering in anticipation of a speedy victory,
and our men, although still burning for vengeance,
were beginning to lose all hope of victory, when the
long expected rocket, announcing the arrival of the
other party, shot up from the dense thicket in the
rear of the fort, and instantaneously a crashing volley
burst from the same quarter, followed by a long,
loud cheer in which was recognised the battle shout
of our comrades. The sounds shivered to the very
hearts of our almost dispirited men, and added new
energy to their souls and fresh vigor to their arms.
Again they demanded to be led to the assault, and,
with fixed bayonets, following their leader, they
dashed up to the very embrasures of the fort. Then
began a slaughter so terrific that the oldest veterans
assured me they had never witnessed the like.
Through an impervious veil of smoke, amid plunging
balls and rattling grape shot, our gallant fellows
swept over the plain, through the ditch, up the embankment,
and into the very heart of the fortification.
At the mouths of their guns they met the pirates,
bearing them bodily backwards at the point of the
bayonet. But if the onslaught was determined the
resistance was desperate. Every step we advanced
was over the dead bodies of the foeman. Throwing
away their muskets, they betook themselves to their
pikes and cutlasses, and though forced to retreat by
our overwhelming numbers, retreating sullenly, like
a lion at bay, they marked their path with the blood
of the assailants. Meanwhile the detachment of our
troops in the rear, finding the defences in that quarter
weaker than those in front, soon carried the entrenchments,
and driving before it as well the immediate
defenders of the walls, as the desperadoes who
had hurried to reinforce them, it advanced with loud
cheers to meet us in the centre of the fortification.
Hemmed in thus on every side, the pirates saw that
further resistance was useless, and were seized with
a sudden panic. Some threw down their arms and
cried for quarter, others cast themselves in despair
on our bayonets, while a few, managing to escape
by cutting their way through a part of our line, took
to the swamps in the rear of the fort, whither they
defied pursuit. In less than an hour from the first
assault, not a pirate was left at large within the precincts
of the settlement. The huts were given to
the flames, and the hulk at the outlet of the lagoon
scuttled and sunk. The other vessels were manned
by our own forces and carried away as trophies.
Thus was destroyed one of the most noted piratical
haunts since the days of the Bucaneers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We learned from the prisoners that the approach
of the expedition had been detected while it was yet
an hour’s sail from the settlement, and that preparations
had instantly been made for our repulse.
Had we not been under a misapprehension as to the
strength of these desperadoes, and thus been induced
to take with us more than double the force we should
otherwise have employed, their efforts would no
doubt have been successful, since the almost impregnable
nature of their defences enabled them to withstand
the assault of a force four times the number of
their own. It was only the opportune arrival of our
comrades, and the surprise which they effected in
their quarter of attack, that gave us the victory after
all. As it was, our loss was terrible. We had extirpated
this curse of society, but at what a price!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wound which I had received was at first
thought to be mortal, but after the extraction of the
ball my case assumed a more favorable aspect. The
crisis of my fate was looked for with anxiety by my
comrades in arms. My return to consciousness
found them, as I have described, watching that event
at my bedside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our voyage was soon completed, and we entered
the port of —— amid the salvos of the batteries and
the merry peals of the various convent bells. The
governor came off to our fleet, almost before we had
dropped our anchors, and bestowed rewards on the
spot on those of his troops who had peculiarly distinguished
themselves. He came at once to my cot,
and would have carried me home to the government-house,
but Mr. Neville, the uncle of the fair girl
whom I had saved from the desperadoes, having
attended his excellency on board, insisted that I
should accept the hospitalities of his home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said his excellency, with a meaning
smile, “I must give him up, for, as you say, mine is
but a bachelor establishment, and hired nurses, however
good, do not equal those who are actuated by
gratitude. But I must insist that my own physician
shall attend him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was still too weak to take any part in this controversy,
and although I made at first a feeble objection
to trespassing on Mr. Neville’s kindness, he only
smiled in reply, and I found myself, in less than an
hour, borne to his residence, without having an opportunity
to expostulate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a relief it is, when suffering with illness,
to be transported from a close, dirty cabin to a large
room and tidy accommodations! How soothing to a
sick man are those thousand little conveniencies and
delicacies which only the hand of woman can supply,
and from which the sufferer on shipboard is debarred!
The well-aired bed linen; the clean and tidy apartment;
the flowers placed on the stand opposite the
bed; the green jalousies left half open to admit the
cooling breeze; the delicious rose-water sprinkled
around the room, and giving it an aromatic fragrance;
and the orange, or tamarind, or other delicacy
ever ready within reach to cool the fevered
mouth, and remind you of the ceaseless care which
thus anticipates your every want. All these, and
even more, attested the kindness of my host’s family.
Yet everything was done in so unobtrusive a manner
that, for a long while, I was ignorant to whom I was
indebted for this care. I saw no one but the nurse,
the physician, and Mr. and Mrs. Neville. But I
could not help fancying that there were others who
sometimes visited my sick chamber, although as yet
I had never been able to detect them, except by the
fresh flowers which they left every morning as evidences
of their presence. More than once, on suddenly
awaking from sleep, I fancied I heard a light
footstep retreating behind my bed, and once I distinguished
the tone of a low sweet voice which sounded
on my ear, tired as it was of the grating accents
of the nurse, like music from Paradise. Often, too,
I heard, through the half open blinds that concealed
the entrance to a neighboring room, the sounds of a
harp accompanied by a female voice; and, at such
times, keeping my eyes closed lest I should be thought
awake and the singer thus be induced to stop, I have
listened until my soul seemed fairly “lapped into
Elysium.” The memory of that ample apartment,
with its spotless curtains and counterpanes, and the
wind blowing freshly through its open jalousies, is
as vivid in my memory to-day as it was in the hour
when I lay there, listening to what seemed the
seraphic music of that unseen performer. I hear
yet that voice, so soft and yet so silvery, now rising
clear as the note of a lark, and now sinking into a
melody as liquid as that of flowing water, yet ever,
in all its variations, sweet, and full, and enrapturing.
Such a voice I used to dream of in childhood as belonging
to the angels in heaven. Our dreams are
not always wrong!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length I was sufficiently recruited in strength
to be able to sit up, and I shall ever remember the
delicious emotions of the hour when I first took a
seat by the casement and looked out into the garden,
then fragrant with the dew of the early morning. I
saw the blue sky smiling overhead, I heard the low
plashing of a fountain in front of my window, I inhaled
the delicate perfume wafted to me by the refreshing
breeze, and as I sat there my soul ran over,
as it were, with its exceeding gladness, and I almost
joined my voice, from very ecstasy, with that of the
birds who hopped from twig to twig, carolling their
morning songs. As I sat thus looking out, I heard a
light footstep on the gravel walk without, and
directly the light, airy form of a young girl emerged
from a secluded walk of the garden, full in my view.
As she came opposite my window she looked up as
if inadvertently, for, catching my eye, she blushed
deeply and cast her gaze on the ground. In a moment,
however, she recovered herself, and advanced
in the direction she had been pursuing. The first
glance at the face had revealed to me the countenance
of her I had been instrumental in rescuing
from the pirates. My apartment, like all those on
the island, was on the ground floor, and when Miss
Neville appeared she was already within a few feet
of me. I rose and bowed, and noticing that she held
a bunch of newly gathered flowers in her hands, I
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is your taste, then, Miss Neville, which has
filled the vase in my room every morning with its
flowers. You cannot know how thankful I am. Ah!
would that all knew with what delight a sick person
gazes on flowers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She blushed again, and extending the bouquet to
me, said with something of gaiety,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I little thought you would be up to-day, much
less at so early an hour, or perhaps I might not have
gathered your flowers. Since you can gaze on them
from your window they will be less attractive to you
when severed, like these, from their parent stem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—never,” I answered warmly, “indeed your
undeserved kindness, and that of your uncle and
aunt, I can never forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me in silence with her large, full
eye a moment ere she replied, and I could see that
they grew humid as she gazed. Her voice, too,
softened and sank almost to a whisper when at length
she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Undeserved kindness! And can we ever forget,”
she said, “what we owe to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words, as well as the gentle tone of reproof
in which they were spoken, embarrassed me for a
moment, and my eyes fell beneath her gaze. As if
unwilling further to trust her emotions, she turned
hastily away as she finished. When I looked up she
was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We met daily after this. The <span class='it'>ennui</span> of a convalescent
made me look forward to the time she spent
with me as if it constituted my whole day. Certainly
the room seemed less cheerful after her departure.
Often would I read while she sat sewing.
At other times we indulged in conversation, and I
found Miss Neville’s information on general subjects
so extensive as sometimes to put me to the blush.
She had read not only the best authors of our own
language, but also those of France, and her remarks
proved that she had thought while she read. She
was a passionate admirer of music, and herself a
finished performer. For all that was beautiful in
nature she had an eye and soul. There was a dash
of gaiety in her disposition, although, perhaps, her
general character was sedate, and late events had
if anything increased its prominent trait. Her tendency
to a gentle melancholy—if I may use the
phrase—was perceptible in her choice of favorite
songs. More than once, when listening to the simple
ballads she delighted to sing, have I caught the
tears rolling down my cheeks, so unconsciously had
I been subdued by the pathos of her voice and
song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few days I was sufficiently convalescent to
leave my room, and thenceforth I established myself
in the one from which I had heard the mysterious
music. This apartment proved to be a sort of boudoir
appropriated to the use of Miss Neville, and it was
her performance on the harp that I had heard during
my sickness. Hers too had been the figure which I
had seen once or twice flitting out of sight on my
awaking from a fevered sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a dangerous thing when two young persons,
of different sexes, are thrown together in daily intercourse,
especially when one, from his very situation,
is forced to depend on the other for the amusement
of hours that would otherwise hang heavily on him.
The peril is increased when either party is bound to
the other by any real or fancied ties of gratitude.
But during the first delicious fortnight of convalescence
I was unconscious of this danger, and without
taking any thought of the future I gave myself
wholly up to the enjoyment of the hour. For Miss
Neville I soon came to entertain a warm sentiment
of regard, yet my feelings for her were of a far different
nature from those I entertained for Annette.
I did not, however, stop to analyze them, for I saw,
or thought I saw, that the pleasure I felt in Ellen’s
society was mutual, and I inquired no further. Alas!
it never entered into my thoughts to ask whether,
while I contented myself with friendship, she might
not be yielding to a warmer sentiment. Had I been
more vain perhaps this thought might have occurred
to me. But I never imagined—blind fool that I was—that
this constant intercourse betwixt us could endanger
the peace of either. If I could, I would
have coined my heart’s blood sooner than have won
the love which I could not return. Yet such was
my destiny. My eyes were opened at length to the
consequences of my indiscretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had been conversing one day of the expected
arrival of <span class='sc'>the Arrow</span>, and I had spoken enthusiastically
of my profession, and, perhaps, expressed
some restlessness at the inactive life I was leading,
when I noticed that Ellen sighed, looked more closely
at her work, and remained silent for some time. At
length she raised her eyes, however, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you explain the passion which a sea-man
entertains for his ship? One would think that
your hearts indulged in no other sentiment than this
engrossing one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wrong us, indeed, Ellen,” I said, “for no
one has a warmer heart than the sailor. But we
have shared so many dangers with our ship, and it
has been to us so long almost our only world, that
we learn to entertain a sort of passion for it, which,
I confess, seems a miracle to others, but which to us
is perfectly natural. I love the old Arrow with a
sentiment approaching to monomania, and yet I have
many and dear friends whom I love none the less for
this passion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I saw that her bosom heaved quicker than usual
at these words, and she plied her needle with increased
velocity. Had I looked more narrowly, I
might have seen the color faintly coming and going
in her cheek, and almost heard her heart beating in
the audible silence. But I still was blind to the cause
of this emotion. By some unaccountable impulse I
was led to speak of a subject which I had always
avoided, though not intentionally—my early intimacy
with Annette, and her subsequent rescue from the
brig. Secure, as I thought, of the sympathy of my
listener, and carried away by my engrossing love
for Annette, I dwelt on her story for some time, totally
unconscious of the effect my words were producing
on Ellen. My infatuation on that morning seems
now incredible. As I became more earnest with my
subject, I noticed still less the growing agitation of
my listener, and it was not until I was in the midst
of a sentence in which I paused for words to express
the loveliness of Annette’s character, that I saw that
Ellen was in tears. She was bending low over her
work so as to conceal her agitation from my eye,
but as I hesitated in my glowing description, a bright
tear-drop fell on her lap. The truth broke on me
like a flash of lightning. I saw it all as clear as by
a noonday sun, and I wondered at my former blindness.
I was stung to the heart by what I had just
been saying, for what agony it must have inflicted on
my hearer! I felt my situation to be deeply embarrassing,
and broke short off in my sentence. After
a moment, however, feeling that silence was more
oppressive than anything else, I made a desperate
effort and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ellen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a single word, and one which I had addressed
to her a hundred times before; but perhaps
there was something in the tone in which I
spoke it, that revealed what was passing in my mind,
for, as she heard her name, the poor girl burst into a
flood of tears, and covering her face with her hands
she rushed from the room. She felt that her secret
was disclosed. She loved one whose heart was
given to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That day I saw her no more. But her agony of
mind could not have been greater than my own.
There is no feeling more acute to a sensitive mind
than the consciousness that we are beloved by one
whom we esteem, but whose affection it is impossible
for us to requite. Oh! the bitter torture to reflect
that by this inability to return another’s love,
we are inflicting on them the sharpest of all disappointments,
and perhaps embittering their life.
Point me out a being who is callous to such a feeling,
and I will point you out a wretch who is unworthy
of the name of man. He who can triumph
in the petty vanity of being loved by one for whom
he entertains no return of affection, is worse than a
fop or a fool—he is a scoundrel of the worst stamp.
He deserves that his home should be uncheered by
a <span style='font-size:smaller'>WOMAN’S</span> smiles, that his dying hour should be a
stranger to her tender care. God knows! to her we
are indebted for all the richest blessings and holiest
emotions of our life. While we remember that we
drank in our life from a mother’s breast—that we
owed that life a thousand times afterwards to a
mother’s care—that the love of a sister or the deeper
affection of a wife has cheered us through many a
dark hour of despair, we can never join that flippant
school which makes light of a woman’s truth, or
follow those impious revilers who would sneer at a
woman’s love. The green sod grows to-day over
many a lovely, fragile being, who might still have
been living but for the perfidy of our sex. There is
no fiction in the oft-told story of a broken heart. It
is, perhaps, a consumption that finally destroys the
victim, but alas! the barb that infused the poison
first into the frame was—a hopeless love. How many
fair faces have paled, how many hearts have grown
cold, how many seraphic forms have passed, like
angel visitants, from the earth, and few have known
the secret of the blight that so mysteriously and suddenly
withered them away. Alas! there is scarcely
a village churchyard in the land, in which some
broken hearted one does not sleep all forgotten in
her lonely bed. The grave is a melancholy home;
but it has hope for the distressed: there, at least, the
weary are at rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is years since I have visited the grave of <span class='sc'>Ellen</span>,
and I never think of her fate without tears coming
into my eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said I saw her no more that day. When I descended
to the breakfast table on the following
morning, I looked around, and, not beholding her,
was on the point of inquiring if she was ill; but, at
the instant, the door opened and one of my old mess-mates
appeared, announcing to me that <span class='sc'>the Arrow</span>
was in the offing, where she awaited me—he having
been despatched with a boat to bring me on board.
As I had been expecting her arrival for several days,
there was little preparation necessary before I was
ready to set forth. My traps had been already despatched
when I stood in the hall to take leave of the
family. My thoughts, at this moment, recurred
again to Ellen, and I was, a second time, on the
point of asking for her, when she appeared. I noticed
that she looked pale, and I thought seemed as
if she had been weeping. Her aunt said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew Ellen had a violent headache, but when
I found that you were going, Mr. Cavendish, I
thought she could come down for a last adieu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I bowed, and taking Miss Neville’s hand raised it
to my lips. None there were acquainted with our
secret but ourselves, yet I felt as if every eye was
on me, and from the nervous trembling of Ellen’s
fingers, I knew that her agitation was greater than
my own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, dear Miss Neville,” I said, and,
in spite of my efforts, my voice quivered, “and may
your days be long and happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I dropped her hand, I raised my eyes a moment
to her face. That look of mute thankfulness, and
yet of mournful sorrow, I never shall forget. I felt
that she saw and appreciated my situation, and that
even thus her love was made evident. If I had
doubted, her words would have relieved me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Farewell!” she said, in a voice so low that no
one heard it but myself. “I do not blame you. God
be with you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears gushed to her eyes, and my own heart
was full to overflowing. I hastily waved my hand—for
I had already taken leave of the rest—sprang
into the carriage, rode in silence to the quay, and
throwing myself into the stern sheets of the barge,
sat, wrapt in my own emotions and without speaking
a word, until we reached the ship. That night I
early sought my hammock; and there prayed long
and earnestly for Ellen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memory of that long past time crowds on me
to-night, and I feel it would be a relief to me to disburden
my full heart of its feelings. I will finish
this melancholy story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a short six months after my departure from
Mr. Neville’s hospitable mansion, when we came
to anchor again in the port, with a couple of rich
prizes, which we had taken a short time before, in
the Gulf Stream. The first intelligence I heard, on
landing, was that Miss Neville was said to be dying
of a consumption. Need I say that a pang of keenest
agony shot through my heart? A something
whispered to me that I was the cause, at least partially,
of all this. With a faltering tongue I inquired
the particulars. They were soon told. I subsequently
learned more, and shall conceal nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the day when I left ——, the health of Ellen
had begun gradually to droop. At first her friends
noticed only that she was less gay than usual, and
once or twice they alluded jestingly to me as the
secret of her loss of spirits. But when the expression
of agony, which at such times would flit across
her face, was noticed, her friends ceased their allusions.
Meanwhile her health began sensibly to be
affected. She ate little. She slept in fitful dozes.
No amusement could drive away the settled depression
which seemed to brood upon her spirits. Her
friends resorted to everything to divert her mind, but
all was in vain. With a sad, sweet smile, she shook
her head at their efforts, as if she felt that they could
do nothing to reach her malady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length she caught a slight cold. She was of a
northern constitution, and when this cold was followed
by a permanent cough, her friends trembled
lest it foreboded the presence of that disease, which
annually sweeps off its thousands of the beautiful
and gay. Nor were they long in doubt. Their
worst fears were realised. <span class='sc'>Consumption</span> had fixed
its iron clutch on her heart, and was already tugging
at its life-strings. The worm was gnawing at the
core of the flower, and the next rough blast would
sweep it from the stalk. As day by day passed, she
drew nearer to the grave. Her eye grew sunken,
but an unnatural lustre gleamed from its depths—the
hectic flush blazed on her cheek—and that dry
hacking cough, which so tortures the consumptive,
while it snaps chord after chord of life, hourly grew
worse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At an early period of Ellen’s illness, Mrs. Neville,
who had been to the orphan girl a second
mother, divined the secret of her niece’s malady.
She did not, however, urge her confidence on her
charge, but Ellen soon saw that her aunt knew all.
There was a meaning in her studied avoidance of
my name, which could not be mistaken. Ellen’s
heart was won by this delicacy, until, one day, she
revealed everything. Mrs. Neville pressed her to
her bosom at the close of the confession, and, though
nothing was said, Ellen felt that the heart of her second
mother bled for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As death drew nearer, Ellen’s thoughts became
gradually freed from this world. But she had still
one earthly desire—she wished to see me before she
died. Only to Mrs. Neville, however, was this desire
confided, and even then without any expectation
that it could be gratified. When, however, <span class='sc'>the Arrow</span>
stopped so opportunely in ——, her petitions
became so urgent, that Mrs. Neville sent for me.
With a sad heart I obeyed her summons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dear girl,” she said, when she met me in
the ante-room, “would not be denied, and, indeed, I
had not the heart to refuse her. Oh! Mr. Cavendish,
you will find her sadly changed. These are
fearful trials which God, in his good providence, has
called us to undergo,” and tears choked her further
utterance. I was scarcely less affected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be a fruitless task in me to attempt to
describe my emotions on entering the chamber of the
dying girl. I have no recollection of the furniture of
the room, save that it was distinguished by the exquisite
neatness and taste which always characterized
Ellen. My eyes rested only on one object—the
sufferer herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was reclining on a couch, her head propped
up with pillows, and her right hand lying listlessly
on the snowy counterpane. How transparent that
hand seemed, with the blue veins so distinctly seen
through the skin that you could almost mark the
pulsation of the blood beneath. But it was her countenance
which most startled me. When I last saw
her—save at that one parting interview—her mild
blue orbs smiled with a sunniness that spoke the joy
of a young and happy heart. Now the wild hectic
of consumption blazed on her cheek, and her eyes
had a brilliancy and lustre that were not of earth.
Then, her rich golden tresses floated in wavy curls
across her shoulders—now, that beautiful hair was
gathered up under the close-fitting cap which she
wore. Then her face was bright with the glow of
health—alas! now it was pale and attenuated. But
in place of her faded loveliness had come a more
glorious beauty; and the glad smile of old had given
way to one of seraphic sweetness. When she extended
her wan hand toward me, and spoke in that
unrivalled voice which, though feeble, was like the
symphony of an Æolian harp, it seemed, to my excited
fancy, as if an angel from heaven had welcomed
me to her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a sad meeting,” she said; for my emotions,
at the sight of her changed aspect, would not
permit me to speak—“but why grieve? It is all for
the best. It might seem unmaidenly to some,” she
continued, with a partial hesitation, while, if possible,
a brighter glow deepened on her cheek, “for
me thus to send for you; but I trust we know each
other’s hearts, and this is no time to bow to the formalities
of life. I feel that I am dying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say not so, dear Ellen,” I gasped, while my
frame shook with agony at the ruin I had brought
about—“oh! say not so. You will yet recover. God
has many happy years in store for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” she said touchingly, “this world is not
for me; I am but a poor bruised reed—it were better
I were cast aside. But weep not, for oh! I meant
not to upbraid you. No, never, even in my first
agony, have I blamed <span class='it'>you</span>—and it was to tell you
this that I prayed I might survive. Yes! dearest—for
it cannot be wrong now to confess my love—I would
not that you should suppose I condemned you even
in thought. You saved my life—and I loved you before
I knew it myself. You weep—I know you do
not despise me—had we met under better auspices,
the result might have been—” here her voice choked
with emotion—“might have been different.” I could
only press her hand. “Oh! this is bliss,” she murmured,
after a pause. “But it was not so to be,”
she added, in a moment, with a saddened tone,
which cut me to the heart. “I should love to see
her of whom you speak—she is very beautiful, is
she not? In heaven the angels are all beautiful.”
Her mind wandered. “I have heard their music
for days, and every day it is clearer and lovelier.
Hear!” and with her finger raised, her eye fixed
on the air, and a rapt smile on her radiant countenance,
she remained a moment silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears fell from us like rain. But by and bye, her
wandering senses returned; and a look of unutterable
wo passed over her face. Oh! how my heart
bled. I know not what I said; I only know that I
strove to soothe the dying moments of that sweet
saint, so suffering, yet so forgiving. A look of happiness
once more lightened up her face, and, with a
sweet smile, she talked of happiness and heaven.
As we thus communed, our hearts were melted. Gradually
her voice assumed a different tone, becoming
sweeter and more liquid at every word, while her
eyes shone no longer with that fitful lustre, but
beamed on me the full effulgence of her soul once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raise me up,” she said. I passed my arm around
her, and gently lifted her up. Her head reposed on
my shoulder, while her hand was still clasped in
mine. She turned her blue eyes on me with a seraphic
expression, such as only the sainted soul in its
parting moment can embody, and whispered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! to die thus is sweet! Henry, dear Henry—God
bless you! In heaven there is no sorrow,” and
then, in incoherent sentences, she murmured of
bright faces, and strange music, and glorious visions
that were in the air. The dying musician said that
he then knew more of God and nature than he ever
knew before, and it may be, that, as the soul leaves
the body, we are gifted with a power to see things
of which no mortal here can tell. Who knows? In
our dying hour we shall learn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grave of Ellen is now forgotten by all, save
me. The grass has grown over it for long years.
But often, in the still watches of the night, I think I
hear a celestial voice whispering in my ear; and
sometimes, in my dreams, I behold a face looking, as
it were, from amid the stars: and that face, all glorious
in light, is as the face of that sainted girl. I
cannot believe that the dead return no more.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A TALE OF A VILLAGE INN.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. A. M. F. ANNAN.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be out of keeping with our subject to apply
the homely epithet of a “fish out of water” to
Mr. Bromwell Sutton in the rural village of G⁠——,
but as no periphrasis suggests itself which would express
his position as well, we must fain eschew elegance
for the occasion, and let it stand. It was a sultry
afternoon, in the middle of summer, when he arrived
at the Eagle Inn, and after changing his dress, stepped
to the door to see what could be seen. He looked up
the street, and down and across, and not a living
thing was visible besides himself, except a few sheep
dozing in the market-house, and two or three cows
silently ruminating in the shade of the town hall,
both of which edifices were near at hand. Then
having decided that there was nothing in the architectural
aspect of the straggling village worth a
second look, he concentred his scrutiny upon himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of his investigation stood thus:—that
he was a very charming young man, was Mr. Bromwell
Sutton. He had a slender, well formed figure,
which was encased in a fresh suit of the finest texture
and most unexceptionable make. His features
were regular, and of that accommodating order
which allows the spectator to assign them any character
he may choose. His complexion was fair and
clear, his teeth were very white and his eyes very
blue. His hair was dark, daintily glossed and perfumed
with oil, and of a length, which, on so warm
a day, would have made a silver arrow or a gilded
bodkin a judicious application; and he had two
elongated tufts on his upper lip, and a round one on
his chin corresponding to the space between them.
He wore a Panama hat of the most extensive circumference,
and carried a pair of white gloves,
either to be drawn on his hands or slapped on his
knees, whichever circumstances might require; and
the corner of a hem-stitched handkerchief of transparent
cambrick stuck out of his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A handbill pasted on the sign-post next caught his
eye, and, though it was a favorite saying with him
that he “never read,” to be understood of course,
not that he never <span class='it'>had</span> read, but that he knew enough
already; he so far conquered his disdain of literature
as to step forward and ascertain its purport. This,
set forth in the interesting typographical variety
which veteran advertisers so well comprehend, of
large and small Romans, and Italics leaning some to
the right and some to the left, and some standing
perpendicular, was as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Azariah Chowders, celebrated throughout
the Union for his eloquent, entertaining and instructive
discourses on miscellaneous subjects, proposes
delivering a lecture on the evening of the present
instant, in the town hall of G⁠——. The theme selected
is, the Genius of the American People, one,
which, from its intrinsic importance, requires no
comment,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was interrupted by the rattle of a distant vehicle,
and looking up the street, saw a chaise approaching
which contained a single “individual,”
as he mentally pronounced him. He drove a fine
horse, and drew him up before the door of the inn.
The chaise was a plain, common looking concern,
full of travel-worn trunks and boxes, and its occupant
was dressed in a light summer suit, rather neat,
but entirely too coarse for gentility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s only a Yankee pedlar,” said Mr. Sutton to the
landlord who was coming out, and entirely careless of
being overheard by the stranger; and he walked up to
his chamber, where he awakened a diminutive poodle,
his travelling companion, from the siesta with which it
was recruiting after its journey, and occupied himself
in cracking his handkerchief at it, until an additional
stir in the house indicated the approach of tea-time.
He then came down, carrying Cupidon, for so was the
animal appellated; and found in the bar-room a young
gentleman, a law-student, to whom he had delivered
a letter on his arrival, and who was a boarder in the
house. The other stranger had, meanwhile, entered
the room, and was cooling himself at an open window,
with his short curling hair pushed back from a
forehead remarkable in its whiteness and intellectual
development, and crowning a face of strikingly
handsome lineaments and prepossessing expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you contrive to exist in this stupid
place?” asked our dandy of his new acquaintance,
whose name was Wallis; “they say there are some
genteel people about,—have you any pretty girls
among them to flirt with?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have some pretty young ladies, but don’t
use them for that purpose exactly,” replied Wallis;
“we admire them, and wait on them and try to
please them, and then, when we can afford it, we
marry them, if they don’t object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen anything of a lady vagabondising
in this region,—a Miss Valeria North?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Valeria North, the fashionable heiress of
B——? the niece of the celebrated Judge North?
what should she be doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,—it’s beginning to be genteel
for people to get tired of society, and to go hunting
up out-of-the-way places that one knows nothing
about except from the maps; I heard in the railroad
cars that she was making a tour along the
river here, and was in hopes that I might fall in
with her. What do you know of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard a great deal about her at Saratoga last
summer, where I happened to stop for a few days.
Every body was talking about her beauty, talents
and accomplishments, and in particular about her
plain and simple manners, so singular in an heiress
and a belle. The young men, mostly, seemed to have
been afraid of her; regarding her as a female Caligula
who would have rejoiced in the power of decapitating
all the silliness, stupidity and puppyism in
the world with one stroke of her wit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!” said Sutton, with a weak laugh that
proved him not to apprehend what he was laughing
at; “I hope she’ll soon come along; I’m prepared
for a dead set at her. Girls of two or three hundred
thousands are worth that trouble; it’s a much pleasanter
way to get pocket money than to be playing
the dutiful son for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallis elevated his eyebrows, but made no other
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, I suppose, is one of your village beauties,—that
one walking in the garden with the pink dress
on and the black apron,” resumed Sutton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; she is a stranger boarding here,—a Miss
Thompson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Thompson!—it might as well be Miss Blank
for all the idea that conveys. Who, or what is
she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She does not say;—there is the name in the register
beside you,—‘<span class='it'>Mrs. Thompson and daughter</span>’—so
she entered it. She and her mother stopped
here a week or two ago, on account of the lady’s
health.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thompsons!—they oughtn’t to be found at out-of-the-way
places; all the genteel Thompsons that I
ever heard of go to springs and places of decided
fashion; it is absolutely necessary, that they may
not be confounded with the mere Thompsons,—the
ten thousand of the name. But that is a pretty
looking girl,—and rather ladyish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is a lady—a well-bred, sensible girl, as ever
I met with, and very highly educated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were interrupted by the bell for tea, and, on
entering the eating-room, they found the young lady
in the pink dress at the table, with an elderly, delicate
looking woman (Mrs. Thompson, of course,)
beside her. Mr. Sutton advanced to the place immediately
opposite to her, and a nearer view suggested
that she might be one of the genteel Thompsons
after all. She was a spirited looking girl, rather
under the middle height, with a clear and brilliant,
though not very fair complexion; large black eyes,
surmounted by wide and distinctly marked eyebrows,
and a broad, smooth forehead; a nose, (that
most <span class='it'>difficult</span> of features, if we may judge by the
innumerable failures,) a nose beautifully straight in
its outline and with the most delicately cut nostrils
possible; and the most charmingly curved lips, and
the whitest teeth in the world. Having made these
discoveries, Mr. Sutton decided that if her station
should forbid his admiring her, he would not allow
it to prevent her from admiring him. To afford her
the benefit of this privilege, it was necessary that he
should first attract her notice, for she had bestowed
but a single glance at him on his entrance, as had
her mother, the latter drawing up her eyelids as if
she had been very near-sighted; and to affect this, he
called, in a peremptory voice to the servant attending,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waiter, I wish you would give my dog something
to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your dog, sir?—where is it?” asked the colored
man, looking around the room, and then giving a
loud whistle to call the invisible animal forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” replied Sutton, sharply; “or you may
bring me a plate and I’ll feed him myself;” and he
pointed to the miniature specimen, lying like a little
lump of floss-silk, on his foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That! I-I-I—he! he! ha! ha!” exclaimed the
waiter, attempting at first to restrain himself, and
then bursting into a chuckling laugh; “is it—really—a
dog, sir?—a live dog!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cupidon, as if outraged by the suspicion, hereupon
sprang into the middle of the room, barking at
the height of his feeble voice, and showing his tiny
white teeth, while his wicked little eyes sparkled
with anger. The cachinnations of the amused and
astonished servant increased at every bark, and drew
a laugh from Wallis, and a smile from each of the
ladies. Sutton with difficulty silenced his favorite,
and finding that the desired impression of his consequence
had not been made, he proceeded to another
essay. “Waiter,” he slowly enunciated, with a
look of disgust at the steel implement in his hand;
“have you no silver forks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir?” said the attendant with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any silver forks?” he repeated emphatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; we don’t keep the article.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you should not put fish on the table; they
ought properly to be inseparable,” he returned, magisterially,
and rising from his seat, he approached
the stranger of the chaise, who had quietly placed
himself some distance below them, and asked,
“Have you any such things as silver forks among
your commodities?—I believe that persons in your
vocation sometimes deal in articles of that description.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger looked up in surprise, and, after scanning
him from head to foot, a frown which was
gathering on his face gave way to a look of humorous
complacency—“I am sorry I can’t accommodate
you, sir,” said he; “but I might probably suggest a
substitute;—how would a tea-spoon do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to his seat, rather dubious about the
smiles he detected, and, as a third effort, addressed
himself, somewhat in the following manner, to Wallis,
whose interlocutions are unnecessary. “How
far did you say it was to the Sutton Mills?—only
four miles, isn’t it? I shall have to apply to you to
show me the way. I have a curiosity to see them, as
they are one of my father’s favorite hobbies. I often
laugh at him for christening them with his own
name. Calling a villa, a fashionable country seat,
after one’s self, is well enough, but mills or manufactories—it
is rather out of taste. Is the fourth
finished yet? I believe it is to be the finest of all;
indeed, it seems to me a little injudicious in the old
gentleman to have invested so much in a country
property—there are at least half a dozen farms, are
there not? but I suppose he was afraid to trust his
funds to stocks, and he has already more real estate
in the city than he can well attend to. However, if
he had handed over the amount to me, I think I
could have disposed of it with a much better grace.
He did offer me a title to them, some time ago, but it
was on condition that I should come here and manage
them myself, but I begged to be excused, and it was
only on agreement that I should have a hundred per
cent. of the revenue this year, that I consented to
undergo the trouble of visiting them, or the sacrifice,
rather—there are so many delightful places to go to
in the summer,” and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having, from these indirect explanations, made a
clear case that his society was entitled to a welcome
from the best Thompson in the world, and to that
with thanks, if his fair neighbor was only a crockery
Thompson, he arose and returned to the front of the
house. The village had, by this time, awakened
from its nap, and the larger proportion of its inhabitants
were bending their steps to the town hall.
Numerous well appointed carriages were also coming
in from the surrounding neighborhood, whose
passengers were all bound to the same point.
“Where are all these people going?” asked Sutton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the lecture announced in that handbill,” replied
Wallis—and Miss Thompson presenting herself
at the door, ready bonnetted, he walked with
her in a neighborly sort of a way across the street.
After a while the throng ceased, and from some impatient
expressions of the loungers about the tavern,
Sutton ascertained that the lecturer had not yet appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that man I mistook for a Yankee pedlar
must be he, I should judge,” said he to the landlord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?—where?” said a young man, who had not
heard the last clause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That tall fellow, in the garden, there, drest in the
brown-holland pantaloons and Kentucky jean coat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!—I thought he was to stop at the other
house;” and he hastened down the street, while Sutton,
finding that every body was going to the hall,
strolled there also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the stranger in the coarse jeans was
enjoying himself in a saunter through the quiet and
pretty garden of the inn, which was so hedged and
enclosed as to admit of no view of the street, when
a consequential personage presented himself, and
saluting him stiffly, introduced himself as “Mr.
Smith, the proprietor of the G⁠—— Hotel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am happy to make your acquaintance, sir,”
said the young stranger, courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have taken the liberty to call, sir, and inform
you that the audience has been waiting for some
time. It is full fifteen minutes past the time announced
in the handbills;” pulling one from his
pocket—“I felt a reluctance to intrude, but, putting
the best construction upon your conduct, in not informing
me of your arrival, after I had been at the
pains to prepare for you, I presumed it proceeded
from a mistake; you are at the opposition establishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There certainly is a mistake,” interrupted the
stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, very well, sir, as an entire stranger
you can be excused,” hastily proceeded Mr. Smith;
“but there is no time to talk about it now—we can
settle it after a while. Be good enough to hurry over;
the people are getting impatient. You will have a
large audience, sir; they were afraid they would be
disappointed, which would have been a bad business,
as we very seldom have lecturers from a distance.
It was lucky that you happened to be found out by
one of my boarders, for some of the gentlemen were
talking about dispersing, and if that had occurred,
we would all have been up in arms against you;—we
are pretty fiery, some of us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you would not be willing to wait another
evening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To wait! certainly not; I hope you have no such
idea!—let me beg you to hurry, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear sir!—let me insist—you have announced
a very interesting subject—‘The Genius of the
American People;’ the very thing for our audience—American
through and through—very patriotic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, sir—I’ll try to do my best—let me
change my dress a little, and I’ll attend you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the surprise of the inmates of the Eagle, excepting,
indeed, Mr. Sutton, who paid a mental tribute
to his own sagacity—in a few minutes their fellow
lodger entered and mounted the rostrum. A
figure as graceful and commanding would have
struck the fastidious assemblage of a fashionable city
lecture-room. He showed some embarrassment after
casting his eyes over the really large audience, but
a round of applause gave him time to collect himself,
and he commenced a modest preface, stating
that he had not had time to arrange his ideas on the
subject proposed, in such a form as he could have
wished, yet as it was one that ought to be familiar
to all good citizens, he hoped he should not entirely
fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We regret that our space will not permit us to
edify our readers with the critique on his performance
which duly appeared in the village newspaper.
Suffice it, that after an elaborate eulogium on his fine
person, captivating voice, and expressive gestures;
his sparkling wit, elevated imagination, and extensive
reading, he was pronounced <span class='it'>ex cathedrâ</span>, “a
patriot, a scholar and a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning, when they met in the breakfast
room, Miss Thompson and Wallis were fluent in
commendation of the lecture. “I was most agreeably
disappointed,” said the lady; “having been
prepared for nothing more than the flippant inanities
we usually hear from itinerant lecturers. This gentleman
is an orator—one that would draw crowds
among the most intellectual communities in the
country. The subject was so hackneyed, that to announce
it appeared ridiculous; but he treated it like
a statesman, and made it really imposing by evidences
of original thought and profound information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was interrupted by the object of her remarks
entering the room—and after he had taken his seat
at the table, she turned and remarked to him, with
respectful complaisance, “you had a large and very
attentive auditory last night, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger bowed and returned, “I was surprised
to find an assemblage so numerous and respectable,
and had every reason to be flattered by their reception.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no doubt you entertained them exceedingly,”
interposed Sutton; “you did very well, very
well, indeed; for a plain country audience, nothing
could have suited them better. I suppose you consider
yourself as having made quite a speculation;
at fifty cents a head the receipts must have been considerable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Thompson glanced at him with a look of irritation,
which, however, changed to one of merriment
at the comic stare of the itinerant, his only answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then there was a bustle in the entry, and the
landlord was heard saying in a tone of expostulation—“The
gentleman is at his breakfast, sir; have
a little patience, and, no doubt, he will satisfy you
afterwards. The other boarders are all at the table,
and it would only cause a confusion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better,” returned a stentorian voice;
“let me in, sir, or you shall be exposed for harboring
a swindler;” and a formidable-looking person, large
of size and exceeding fierce of countenance, entered.
He was accompanied by Mr. Smith of the rival
house, who designated the lecturer, and striding
up to him, he exclaimed, in a strong Connecticut accent,
“So, sir! you are the gentleman that entertained
this community last evening with a lecture on
the ‘Genius of the American People;’ you are Azariah
Chowders, are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sir?—by no means! I rejoice in quite a different
appellation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No sir,—I myself am Azariah Chowders, and I
hereby pronounce you an impudent imposter. I demand
to know, sir, how you could dare to avail yourself
of my name and well-earned reputation to deliver
a spurious lecture and rob the pockets of a large
audience?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From several reasons, sir. In the first place,
to relieve the solicitude of that gentleman, Mr.
Smith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That shall not serve you! your flagitious conduct,—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray hear me out, sir! secondly, as he assured
me a number of persons would be disappointed if they
should not hear a lecture—common philanthropy—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A benevolent youth, upon my word!” laughed
Mr. Chowders in derision; “I’ll not listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then for my third and last reason,—how could
I resist such a capital opportunity for showing off?
A gentleman of your aspiring disposition should not
be too severe upon the ambition of others. I had no
fame of my own to procure me a welcome, and as
there was no claimant for yours,—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Young man, you had better confess the truth at
once! you could not resist the temptation of pocketing
the dollars which you know would be collected
on my credit. I shall have redress, sir—there are
such things as indictments for swindling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good sir! you certainly would not menace
me with anything so terrific! remember how much
labor I have taken off your hand,—the exertion of
your brain and lungs, besides securing for you every
cent of the admittance fees. Landlord, oblige me
by bringing here the handkerchief which I requested
you last night to deposit in your desk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The host of the Eagle complied with alacrity, and
the young stranger unrolling his handkerchief, displayed
a collection of notes and silver, particularly
inviting in these hard times. The sight of it mollified
the assailant at once. “Here, sir,” said the other,
“you have the emoluments of the lecture just as
they were placed in my hands by the gentleman beside
you, Mr. Smith. My worthy host will be my
voucher that I have not seen it since; and I think I
may be equally confident that it has lost nothing by
being in his possession. I beg pardon if I have incommoded
you by presuming to supply your place;
but I hope your friend, Mr. Smith, will do me the
justice of attributing it in part to his mistake and solicitations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Willingly,” said Mr. Smith; “and in explanation
of my share of the business, it originated from a
remark made by that gentleman,” nodding towards
Mr. Sutton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Chowder, with some accession of graciousness,
remarked that an accident to his carriage had
caused the delay on his part, and he condescended to
add, that it was well enough some one had been
found to entertain the company in his stead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are lenient, sir,” said the offender, “and, in
return, I give you my word that I shall never again
attempt to win a laurel leaf in your name. The
audience shall be undeceived, and all the opprobrium
of my presuming to represent your oratorical
abilities shall rest on myself. At present, I have no
other security to offer than my name, which, however,
I hope will prevent similar mistakes for the
future,” and he glanced at Sutton; “it is Norman
Oakley, and my occupation is that of an artist,—a
painter,” and the visiters retired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather a ferocious gentleman, that Mr. Azariah
Chowders,” said Wallis who, with Miss Thompson
had witnessed the scene, much to their amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite,” returned the painter, resuming his natural
manner; “though I had prepared myself for a
much stronger demonstration of it;—perhaps, because
I felt that I deserved it. He could not have
been more surprised at finding himself counterfeited
than I was on presenting myself in your lecture-room.
I had expected to meet with some little literary
society, or association for mutual improvement,
such as are common in your villages, and assented
to the importunity of the committee-man without explaining
the mistake, in expectation that I might
have some diversion of my own from it. When I
found an assemblage of the whole community, I felt
inclined, through respect for them, to make an explanation
and withdraw; but, on second thought, concluded
that as I had gone so far, I might as well remain
and do my best to afford them a little entertainment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that brown-holland chap seemed to think
he would elevate himself a peg by letting us know
that he is a painter;—I should like to know how
much more elegant it is to stroll about painting than
peddling or lecturing,” said Mr. Sutton to Wallis,
when they had left the table; “but that Miss Thompson
is an astonishingly handsome girl; what a complexion
she has!—what eyes and what teeth!—what
a sensation she would make in society—that is, if
she had a fortune and somebody to show her off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better offer her yours, and engage in
the service yourself,” said Wallis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money for money,—‘like loves like;’ it is a
generally received opinion among <span class='it'>us</span> that a good-looking
fellow, fashionable and well connected, is
an equivalent for a woman with fifty thousand dollars
any day. If he has a fortune, she should be
worth dollar for dollar besides. I don’t know what
this Miss Thompson is, so I believe I’ll wait till Valeria
North comes along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Valeria North! why, my dear fellow, she would
annihilate you!” returned Wallis, and he thought to
himself, “this is the most ridiculous jackanapes I
have ever met with; if I must be bored with his acquaintance,
I’ll have a little fun with him;” and he
added in a significant tone, “I thought there was
some sort of magnetism by which you people of
fashion found each other out. Is it possible you
have not seen into Miss Thompson yet? Between
ourselves she is as great an heiress as Miss North.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say so!—well, she looks as if she deserved
to be. Come, Wallis, introduce me, and Miss
North may go to the dickens.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry I can’t oblige you; but as I have
merely talked to Miss Thompson, myself, as a fellow-boarder,
I am not privileged to introduce a
stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter, we men of the world can manage
such things. They are in that room, aren’t they?
and by good luck Cupidon has sneaked in. I’ll go
after him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg pardon, ladies, if I intrude,” said he bowing;
“but my dog⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, sir, this is the common parlor of the
house,” returned Mrs. Thompson, quietly, and
scarcely looking up from her work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus happily possessed of the freedom of the
room, Mr. Sutton turned over some books on a
table, and at length remarked, when he had caught
the eye of Miss Thompson, “These country villages
are monstrously tiresome to persons accustomed to
a city life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are they?” said she, and looked again on her
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say that Saratoga is unusually thronged
this year,” he resumed after a pause; “I had the
pleasure of meeting with a young lady of your name
there last summer;—indeed, I had quite a flirtation
with her; perhaps she was a relation of yours—the
daughter of old General Thompson of Virginia.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the least,” said the young lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judge Thompson, of one of the New England
states, was there, at the same time, with his daughters.
Very elegant girls all of them,—quite belles.
They are of a different family,—perhaps of yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No sir, they are not,” returned Miss Thompson,
impatiently giving her reticule a swing, which raised
Cupidon off his feet, that important character having
laid siege to the tassels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Laissez aller</span>, Cupidon! a thorough-bred Parisian
animal, Miss,—he does not understand a word
of English. He was a keepsake from a particular
friend of mine, Baron Mont Tonnére. You may
have met with the baron; he was quite a lion among
our <span class='it'>élite</span>? By the by, a Miss Thompson came very
near being the baroness,—she was one of the Thomas
Thompsons of New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the best families in the country,—the
same as the B. B. Thompsons of Philadelphia, the
Brown Thompsons of Charleston, and the Thoroughgood
Thompsons of Boston.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem quite <span class='it'>au fait</span> to the Thompsons;” said
the elder lady; and turning to her daughter, they
resumed a conversation, which he had interrupted,
about the lecture and the lecturer, Miss Thompson
expressing a wish to see some of his productions, and
her confidence that a person of his evidently cultivated
taste must possess merit as a painter. Mr. Sutton,
as is common with vain people, drawing his conclusions
from his own practice, presumed, of course,
that all their fine talking was specially aimed at his
favor, and when the younger lady, in return for his
occasional interpositions, gave him a disdainful
glance of her full black eyes, he admired her art in
displaying their brilliancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The garden of the inn commanded one of the loveliest
views among the finest river scenery in our
country, an exquisite combination of glassy water,
little green islets, hills of every variety of form, and
mountains, rising one behind another till their outlines
grew almost imperceptible in the distance.
This, in the light of a magnificent sunset caught the
eye of the young painter from a little summer-house
in which he had been reading, and he hastened to
his room for his portfolio. On his return he commenced
sketching with such intentness that he did
not perceive that Miss Thompson had taken possession
of his former post, until she addressed him with
the remark, “You have a most admirable subject for
your pencil before you, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beautiful, beautiful!” returned he, warmly; “I
never have beheld anything in this order of scenery
to surpass it, though, indeed, this glorious river presents,
in its whole course, a panorama of views so
varied and each so perfect, that it is difficult to decide
upon any one as claiming the strongest admiration.
I have been tracing it for several months, my
store of sketches accumulating every day, and the
larger number of them such as would require the
hand of a master to do them justice. I sometimes
almost despair, and feel inclined to abandon my art
from the difficulties I find in attempting not to disgrace
my subjects,—such as these for instance,—they may
be familiar to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid before her several sketches, and, observing,
with evident pleasure, her expression of admiration
he continued,—“This and this I have finished
in oil, if it will afford you any amusement, I shall
bring them down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She assented with thanks and the pictures were
produced. She scanned them over and over again,
as if not new to connoisseurship, and when she
turned her eyes to the painter from his work, they
sparkled with delight that brought a flush to his face.
“There is a view which you cannot yet have found;”
said she, “one but a few minutes walk from here.
I would rather see it on canvass, if executed in the
spirit of these, than any Claude I have ever heard of!—when
you have seen it I am confident you will undertake
it. Will you let me point it out to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The painter cast upon her one of those quick,
searching looks that belong to the profession, and
was so struck with the intellectual beauty of her
glowing and earnest face, that he forgot to reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this gorgeous sunset it must be magnificent
beyond imagination,” she continued, catching up a
bonnet beside her; “if we hurry we shall yet have
time to see it. Will you go now?” He merely
bowed, without any common-places about “the
pleasure” or the “happiness,” and laying down his
portfolio, he closed the door of the edifice to secure
his property, and set off beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what did you think of Miss Thompson?”
asked Wallis of Mr. Sutton the next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has splendid black eyes, and how well she
knows it too! but she is quite too shy,—I couldn’t
draw her out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was talking fast enough to Mr. Oakley, last
evening,—I saw them walking together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you!” exclaimed Sutton, in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and if you don’t take care, he’ll spoil your
flirtation before you get it rightly underweigh. He
is as handsome a fellow as ever I saw, and as gentlemanlike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sutton glanced down at himself. “Oh, I don’t
mind such things;” said he magnanimously; “indeed,
I should rather give her credit for encouraging
the young man. It is fashionable now to patronise
such people. I intend to give him something to do
myself, particularly as it will gratify the young lady.
She expressed a wish yesterday to see some of his
work, and I promised her to employ him on myself.
Do you paint portraits, Mr. O-Oakton?—that I believe
is the province of country artists;” he added to the
painter who had presented himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I do,—when I find a face worth
painting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, of course;—I have just been saying
that I intend to get you to take mine. It may be of
some service in getting you into business here. I
hope you will not bore me by making me sit often.
When can you begin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any time,—now if you choose,—it won’t require
long to take <span class='it'>you</span> off. I have my portfolio at hand,
and can do it at once. Take this seat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father,” pursued the dandy; “is noted as a
patron of the fine arts. He, however, seldom employs
young artists, as they don’t yield him the worth
of his money. He says that after a painter gets up to
a hundred dollars a head for portraits, or for a square
yard of other things, he thinks he may trust him,
as his productions may then be supposed to be good.
He had the ceilings of his drawing-rooms frescoed
by Monachisi, which was very expensive, and, besides,
he has employed several other of the popular
artists;” giving an enumeration which, in accuracy,
scarcely fell short of that by the erudite hero of
Fielding—“Ammyconni, Paul Varnish, Cannibal
Scratchi, and Hogarthi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please to shut your mouth, sir;” said the Painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, don’t make a fright of me;” resumed Mr.
Sutton; “try your best, and I may, very probably,
give you another job. How would you like to paint
Miss Thompson for me?—when she gets over her
shyness I’ll propose it to her, if you succeed in this.
She is a confounded pretty girl, don’t you think so?—quite
as handsome as some of the portraits in the
Book of Beauty,”⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your mouth shut, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The picture proposed by Miss Thompson was
commenced, and whether it was from the excellence
of the subject, or the eloquence of her suggestions,
the painter exerted upon it his best ability. Their
mutual interest in it was a bond of acquaintance
which strengthened as the work proceeded, and
every day developed some new qualities in each,
which could not have failed to endow their intercourse
with attraction. He was a noble young man,
altogether,—full of talent, generous feelings and high-toned
principles; and of a buoyant, mirthful spirit
and powers of adapting himself to circumstances so
rarely found with lofty intellect and so delightful
when they accompany it. His fair companion was
not less richly endowed by nature and education,
but it was only by those who could appreciate the
stronger points of her character that she would have
been equally admired. These perpetually exhibiting
themselves in an ardent enjoyment of every thing
beautiful in thought, sentiment or the external world,
and in an intrepid scorn of any thing like vanity,
selfishness or insincerity, gave her manners a cast
that among the conventional world would have denounced
her as “odd,” yet there was a grace in
her energy, that, to those who understood her, made
it an additional charm. In short, they might have
had a multiplicity of excuses, if they had chosen to
fall in love with each other, but of this there were
no indications. They walked together with perfect
freedom, entirely careless or unconscious of remark;
and they talked together, appearing pleased if they
agreed in opinions, or if they differed, opposing each
other with equal firmness and politeness. Their deportment
was without coquetry on her part and without
gallantry on his. All they knew of each other
was that he was a painter and a very gifted one,
and that she was a very fascinating Miss Thompson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, Mr. Sutton’s flirtation with, or rather
at our heroine, for he had it all to himself, was in
active progress. He made himself intolerable by the
airs and graces he assumed, to recommend himself
to her favor. He never tied his cravat, nor wrapped
a <span class='it'>papillote</span> without a design upon her heart. He
followed her about the garden, paying the most vapid
compliments, or, intruding into the parlor, while she
and her mother were reading, amused them with
“easie sighs which men do breathe in love.” She
attempted at first to repel him with witty sarcasms,
but that, as Wallis remarked, “was like Queen
Christina shooting at a fly—his apprehension was so
small it could scarcely be hit.” She darted contempt
at him from her bright black eyes, and curled her
lip in the most unequivocal fashion, but that only
made her look prettier, and he could see no deeper.
She essayed a plain rebuff, but he thought it a capital
joke. It never entered his head that Mr. Bromwell
Sutton could be any thing but irresistible to a
Miss Thompson. To get rid of him, she at last found
entirely out of the question, and wearied of her
efforts, she concluded to let him take his own course.
This passiveness seemed to him so encouraging, that
one day he was on the point of making a declaration
and was only prevented by the dinner-bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards the artist he continued his patronizing
condescension, with a not unfrequent interlude of
actual incivility, which, to the surprise even of Miss
Thompson, that gentleman passed over with unresisting
composure. On the present occasion the latter
variation predominated, and after they had left the
table, Miss Thompson remarked “I wonder Mr.
Oakley, at your patience in submitting to the impertinences
of that popinjay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would not have me challenge him?” said
the painter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be rather too heroic,—your position
is as defenceless as my own. These “gentlemen’s
sons!”—if I were a man, there is no reproach I
should dread, more than being called one of them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather a sweeping condemnation,” said the
artist, smiling; “but I think I have prepared a
revenge that will reach the specimen before us;”
and having perceived the subject of their remarks
approaching from the summer-house, he called to
him, “Will you step here, for a moment, Mr.
Sutton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t—I haven’t time;” said Sutton, hurrying
on, and they both noticed in him marks of much perturbation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your portrait is finished, and I wish you to see
it;” persisted Oakley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His portrait was too closely connected with himself,
not to have influenced him under any circumstances,
and, accordingly, he stopped while the
painter left the room for it, calling, as he did so,
“Mr. Wallis—landlord—gentlemen,—I wish to have
your opinion of Mr. Sutton’s portrait; oblige me by
coming into the parlor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They complied and the picture, which was of a
miniature size, was placed in the proper light. Miss
Thompson gave it a single glance, and burst into an
apparently irrepressible laugh. Mrs. Thompson,
regarding her with much surprise, drew up her eyes,
and stooped forward to examine it, and then, though
she gave her daughter and the artist a deprecating
look, she also turned away to conceal a smile.
Wallis turned first to the picture, then to Sutton, and
then to Cupidon, and made no effort to restrain his
mirth, in which he was joined by the party of spectators
who had accompanied him. Every one perceived
that it was a correct likeness of Sutton in features,
while the expression was strikingly that of the
little poodle. The dandy himself could not fail to
recognize it, and looked around him, pale with wrath
and mortification, bestowing the fiercest of his looks
on Miss Thompson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t tell me what you think of my performance,
Mr. Sutton,” said Oakley, with much gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not bear your insults, sir!” exclaimed Sutton
at length; “I’ll not tolerate your libellous insolence!—what
do you mean, sir?—what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Insults! I’ll leave it to this company if I have not
succeeded admirably! it reflects you as a mirror!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not put up with it! I’ll not pay you a cent;
I’ll leave it on your hands, and we’ll see who’ll have
the best of the joke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do sir!” said the artist; “it will be then my
property, and I can do what I please with it! I’ll put
it up in some exhibition labelled with your name!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your station protects you sir!” he resumed; “if
you were not beneath my vengeance, you should
answer for this, but a gentleman can, with honor,
only demand satisfaction of his equals,—therefore
you are safe! Landlord,” he added with an assumption
of dignified composure; “make out my bill;
I’ll go instantly to the other house;—you must be
taught that a gentleman cannot patronize an establishment
where he is liable to be insulted by any
scrub that frequents it!” and again looking daggers
at Miss Thompson, who had not ceased laughing, he
left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In truth, had it not been for the almost insupportable
ridicule that accompanied it, Mr. Sutton would
have rejoiced in the excuse to leave the house, from
a discovery that he had just made. After dinner,
while in quest of Miss Thompson, who was at that
time in conversation with Oakley, he had strolled
into the summer-house, and found a letter on the
floor. It was without direction, and though closed,
not sealed, and more through blindness than curiosity
he opened it. To his dismay it commenced thus:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My dear, dear Miss North</span>—How can I give you
any idea of the gratitude I feel for the last and greatest
of your many kindnesses; you have made me so
happy that I have not words to express myself, and
not only me, but my dear mother, who says that
you have done her more good than could have been
effected by a whole college of physicians, for her
health, at the prospect of a pleasant home, and freedom
from incessant mental labour, begins already to
come back again. We have given up our school,
and are preparing to act upon the arrangements you
have made for us. I have received a delightfully
kind letter from your uncle,—he begs me to consider
him as <span class='it'>mine</span>; in which he says he will come for us
very soon, and requests me to enclose any communication
for you to him. He speaks flatteringly of the
satisfaction our company will give him while you
are on your travels beyond the Atlantic. He little
knows how impossible it will be to supply <span class='it'>your</span>
place!” etc. etc.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Sutton read no more. It was signed L. Thompson,
and that was sufficient. He unconsciously
thrust the letter into his pocket, and hurried to the
house. How was he to back out?—it now struck
him that less importance could be attached to his
actions by others than himself, and he grew nervous
at the thought of how he had committed himself:—that
he had paid the most unequivocal attentions to—a
schoolmistress! The artist’s triumph indeed relieved
him on that score, but a new sting was planted,
and a more miserable dandy was, perhaps, not
that day in existence, than Bromwell Sutton when he
applied for lodgings at the G⁠—— Hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our work is finished at last!” said the painter, a
few days after this happy riddance, bringing down
the piece, which had afforded them so much enjoyment,
for the inspection of Miss Thompson. She
was gathering up some books from the parlor tables
with a thoughtful and pensive countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must take a ‘last lingering look’ at it,”
returned she; “I may never see it nor its original
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oakley looked at her anxious and inquiringly, and
she continued, “We leave here to-day; an unexpected
letter reached us this morning, urging us to
be ready at any hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what am I to do without you?” asked the
artist, in a very natural and love-like way, and he
followed the question with a short oration, unnecessary
to repeat. But before he had finished it, a carriage
stopped at the door, and in half a minute an
elderly gentleman presented himself in the entry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My uncle!” exclaimed Miss Thompson, running
forward to conceal her confusion, and the old gentleman,
after kissing her heartily, said quickly, “Are
you ready, my dear? Where’s your mamma? I hope
you have your trunks packed, as I have hardly a
minute to allow you. I have urgent business awaiting
me at home, and have only been able to fulfil
my engagement to come for you, by travelling with
all the speed possible. Quick—tell your mother,
and put on your things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the disappointment of her suitor, she ran up
stairs, while the old gentleman busied himself in
seeing the trunks secured behind the carriage. But
immediately, with her mother, she came down, fully
equipped, and while the old lady was shaking hands
with the uncle, she had an opportunity to give him
a single look, which one was sufficient: “Good bye,
Mr. Wallis,” said she holding out her hand in passing
him, “we have been such good friends, that I feel
very sorry to part with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I find you?” asked Oakley, in a low
voice. She slipped a card into his hand as he assisted
her into the carriage, and was driven away. He
looked at the card. “<span class='sc'>Valeria North</span>, B⁠——,” he exclaimed;
“Is it possible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—didn’t you know that before?” said Wallis,
“and that old gentleman is the celebrated jurist Judge
North. When Sutton finds it out, he’ll be more fretted
than he was at the portrait. She is a charming
girl, isn’t she? I recognized her the minute she
arrived, having had a glimpse of her before she left
the Springs last summer, but as she seemed to wish
to be quiet, and to escape attention, it was not my
business to blab. I’ll go up to Smith’s and have some
fun with Sutton.” He walked up street, and the
artist commenced preparations for an immediate departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why Sutton,” said Wallis, when he reached the
room of that personage; “what possessed you to
fly off, the other day, with such terrible frowns at
the pretty girl you had been courting so long? It was
outrageous, and what is the worst, you can’t have a
chance to make it up,—she left town to-day, for
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she?—a pleasant journey to her!” said
Sutton, brightening up astonishingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!—she jilted you, did she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She! I found her out in good time for that!—though
if it had not been for a lucky accident, I might
have got myself into a confounded scrape; it would
have been a fine mess, if I had been deceived into
proposing to a schoolmistress!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Schoolmistress!—what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, look here—you were a pretty sap to suppose
her an heiress, and to make me believe it:—read
this—I found it by chance, and, somehow, it
got into my pocket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed the letter to Wallis, who, after looking
over it, remarked, “I see nothing to the contrary in
that. I suppose it came enclosed in an envelope
from her uncle. Can it be possible that you presumed
she had written instead of received it! ha!
ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mystified dandy gave him a stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you never suspected that it was Miss North
whose acquaintance you cut so cavalierly! It was,
positively;—she gave her card to Mr. Oakley before
she went away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it!—why would she call herself
Thompson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She didn’t call herself Thompson—that was inferred
to be her name, as it was her mother’s. I
recollect very well of hearing at Saratoga that the
old lady had had two husbands. The last was a
Mr. Thompson. What an opportunity you have
lost of making one of the greatest matches in the
country!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all the fault of that rascally painter,” said
Sutton, in much vexation; “I had commenced declaring
myself the very day he excited me by his
abominable caricature, and if it had not been for
that I would have had an explanation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would make him repent it, if I were you—I’d
challenge him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, you know that’s out of the question—a
gentleman degrades himself by challenging an inferior,”
and he walked up and down the room in
great agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then about that letter—does she know you
found it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—I’m perfectly safe there—you won’t tell,
will you? After all, it is not yet too late to make it
up. I can go after her to B——; she will, no
doubt, take it as a compliment to be followed, and,
you know, it will be in my favor that I was so devoted
before I knew who she was, won’t it? You
might be of great service to me, my dear fellow,” he
added, thinking to prevent Wallis from informing on
him by making him his ally; “you have been in my
confidence and knew how much I was smitten with
her. She is, perhaps, offended by my desertion, and
if you would go along, as she has a particular regard
for you, you might help to effect a reconciliation. If
you’ll go, I’ll pay your expenses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallis, who had no objection to take a trip and
see the end of the comedy, on such easy terms, replied,
“Anything to oblige you, if you can wait two or
three weeks. I have particular business on hands now,
but when I am through with it, I’ll go with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sutton was obliged to submit to the delay, and in
due time they arrived at B⁠——. After arranging
their dress, they sallied out to make inquiry about
Miss North, when an acquaintance of Sutton encountered
them, and stopped them for a talk.
While they stood in the street, an elegantly dressed
young man passed them, and looking back, in a
familiar voice saluted Wallis. It was Oakley.
“How do you do, Mr. Sutton—happy to see you,”
said he, turning towards them, and saluting Sutton
with a very low bow. The dandy returned a nod,
and the painter having ascertained their lodgings,
proceeded on his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a remarkably fine looking fellow that is,”
said Sutton’s acquaintance; “I should have been
pleased if you had introduced me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh he is not such an acquaintance as one introduces—I
have merely patronized him a little as a
strolling painter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norman Oakley!—are you not under a mistake?
He is the son of one of the wealthiest gentlemen
in New England—a very highly gifted young
man—a finished orator—a fine amateur painter—in
every respect an admirable and enviable fellow. By
the by, it is said there is a recent engagement between
him and our belle <span class='it'>par excellence</span>, Miss North.
She has been travelling through different parts of the
country, preparatory to making a tour in Europe,
and, this summer, they met accidentally somewhere
and fell in love, quite ignorant of anything relating
to each other but mutual personal attractions—so
the story goes. They are to be married shortly, so
that the lady may have the pleasure of a legal protector
for her Atlantic trip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sutton could bear no more, and, excusing himself,
he hurried back to the hotel at such a rate that Wallis,
finding it difficult to keep up with him, strolled off
in another direction. When they met again the disappointed
lover was prepared for a retreat homeward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Sutton, that would be outrageous!” said
Wallis; “you ought to have a settlement with Oakley,
now that you find he is fully on a level with
yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t dirty my fingers with him—I wouldn’t
let the mynx know that I thought her worth fighting
about; for they would be sure to attribute it to that,
instead of to the picture. I am off, forthwith. Do
you go back to G⁠——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in a few days—but, the fact is, I met Oakley
again, after you had left me, and got an invitation
to the wedding. He said he would take me to
see Miss North this evening if I wished it, but I
declined, on the plea that I would be only in the
way. But he said there was a charming little girl
there, Miss Thompson—a relative of Valeria’s step-father,
who would appropriate my company, if I
pleased. From his remarking that she is to remain
with the judge after the departure of his niece, I
presumed her to be the writer of the letter in your
possession. <span class='it'>Apropos</span> of that letter—he questioned
me as to whether you had found it, and hinted that
Miss North intended it for your hands, knowing the
effect it would have on you, from your aversion to
poverty, low caste, &amp;c., that she even tore off the
date to mislead you the more easily—hand it here till
we see if that is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sutton deigned no reply, and before Wallis was
ready for his evening visit, he had travelled the first
fifty miles of his journey homeward.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Report addressed to M. Polechko, Captain Isprawnik,
of the District of Oustiaje, by Mikita Muranow,
Mayor of the village of Trehmiria.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“On the 20th of April, 1839, Nadiejda Yakovlevna,
daughter of Yakov Osipovitch, fisherman of Trehmiria,
came to my house in tears: she was in such
great distress that I could only learn from her, that
an assassination had been committed at the village.
I went with her to her father’s, and there I found extended
upon a bed, a man, pale and livid, nearly
cold, but still breathing. Yakov and his wife were
endeavoring to staunch the blood which flowed from
his wounds. On the floor beside the bed were his
garments soaked with water. The young girl could
not attend to my questions, so great was her emotions;
but Yakov told me that his daughter had gone
out before daylight to withdraw the sweep-nets
which at this season are placed along the isles and
shores of the Volga. The fisherman himself was
engaged in spreading nets by the light of a lantern,
when he heard cries, and recognized the voice of
his daughter. He ran along the shore, and thought
he saw in the dim twilight, a large boat passing down
the river with all the rapidity of the current. A moment
afterwards his daughter’s boat approached the
shore, and in it was a man, whom she had taken from
the water in a state of insensibility. After having
carried him to his cabin, he recognized in him,
Ivan Semenov, cornet in the regiment of the lancers
of Archanguelk, who, two years before, had been
quartered in this village.—This is what I have learned
from the fisherman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ivan Semenov’s wounds are so numerous and
deep, that I can scarcely dare to hope he will be
alive when you reach this place.—Please to bring a
physician with you.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Report of Nicolas Peterowitch Polechko, Captain
Isprawnik of the District of Oustiaje, to the chancery
of the Governor of Novogorod.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“I arrived on the night of the 20th of April, at
the village of Trehmiria, with the physician of the
district, M. Frants Frantsovitch, Mayor; we found
in the cabin of the fisherman, Yakov Osipovitch, M.
Ivan Prokovitch Semenov, lately a cornet in the
regiment of Archanguelk. He had received fifteen
wounds, but the physician assured me they were
not mortal, and that he would certainly recover.
The wounded man told me that his assassins were
Paul Ivanovitch Hortinja, quarter-master, and Pierre
Alexiecivitch Tsaryna, soldier in the regiment of the
lancers of Archanguelk. At the time he was
wounded, the Cornet Semenov was on his way to
Rybinsk, in a boat which belonged to his father, and
which was loaded with linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left the physician with the wounded man, and
without losing a moment, hastened to Rybinsk.
There, aided by the police, I sought out the assassins,
one of whom, the quarter-master, Hortinja, was
known to me. At the wharf I learned that a boat,
laden with linen, and having two men on board, arrived
that morning, the 21st of April; and that the
cargo was shortly afterwards sold to an Armenian
merchant of Astracan. I then proceeded to the residence
of the buyer, Jerome Smilabej, who confessed
that he had bought the linen, which was
worth 20,000 roubles, for 10,000—that he had this
day paid 4,000 and was to pay the other 6,000
on the 1st of May at Astracan. I did not place much
confidence in what he told me, for I knew this race
of merchants were liars, and that they encouraged
and protected crime when they expected to profit by
it. Besides, I observed considerable embarrassment
on his countenance. I then asked him where the
linen was? He said he had despatched it to Astracan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Impossible!’ observed I. ‘You bought it this
morning, and the steamboat does not go until to-morrow.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said he had sent it on in the same boat, having
bought it with the cargo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘And what rowers did you employ?’ asked I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He turned pale, and stammered, ‘I employed the
same who brought it here.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this reply, I seized him by the collar, threatening
to conduct him to the police office, when, suddenly,
the door of the room in which we were,
opened, and a man rushed upon me, poignard in
hand. I recognized Hortinja, and drew my sword
to parry his blows. I also placed myself between
him and the door, crying a ‘murderer! an assassin!’
Fortunately for me, the Armenian, instead of trying
to aid Hortinja, hid himself under the bed. The men
of the house soon came to my assistance, but it was
some time before we could disarm and bind the assassin.
In the struggle he wounded three men besides
myself. I bear three marks of his steel upon
my breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After securing Hortinja, we drew the Armenian
from under the bed, and he then confessed that the
other accomplice was half a league from Rybinsk
with the boat, waiting for his comrade. I immediately
sent for some of the police, and Tsaryna was
arrested without offering any resistance.”</p>

</div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>INQUIRY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“In consequence of an order from the Imperial
Attorney, I, Nicolas Petrovitch Polechko, Captain
Isprawnik of the District Oustiaje, went on the 26th
of the month to the village of Trehmiria, where I
proceeded to the inquiry in the following order:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first person I examined was Ivan Prokovitch
Semenov, who declared himself to be 28 years
of age, son of Prokop Karlovitch Semenov, a merchant
of Kostroma, who possessed a factory in that
neighborhood, where he manufactured much linen,
which formed the principal part of his commerce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Semenov entered the military service in 1830, in
the regiment of the Lancers of Archanguelk. He
was appointed cornet of the said regiment in 1836.
He commanded the second division of the third
squadron, in which Hortinja was quarter-master,
and Tsaryna a common soldier. In 1836, the division
of Cornet Semenov was cantoned in the village
of Trehmiria. In 1837, he handed in his resignation
that he might return home to his father. On
the 12th of November, 1838, Hortinja and Tsaryna
came to Kostroma, to the house of Prokop Semenov.
The former said he had left the army, the latter
that he had obtained a six months’ leave of absence.
The Cornet Semenov welcomed them as old comrades.
He engaged Hortinja in the service of his
father, and gave Tsaryna a handsome present to enable
him to pass the six months amongst his relations.
Hortinja behaved so well that he gained the
confidence of old Semenov, who sent him twice in
the spring to Rybinsk with linen. After having sold
the cargo and the boat, he brought back the money
with the greatest exactness. On the 15th of April,
another cargo of linen was ready to go to Rybinsk,
and this time young Semenov was to go with him to
that city, and from there make a voyage to Astracan.
On the evening before their departure Tsaryna arrived,
and as he had been a sailor before he entered
the army, he begged the Cornet Semenov to employ
him instead of engaging another sailor, telling him
that it was time he was on his way to rejoin his regiment,
which he said was cantoned at Novogorod-la-Grande.
Semenov consented, and set out next day
in the boat with Hortinja, Tsaryna, a peasant sailor,
and a servant. On the second day the sailor and
servant were both taken so violently ill with the
cholic, that they were obliged to leave the boat and
remain behind at the village of Bahorka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the 19th, Semenov remarked that Hortinja and
Tsaryna had secret conferences, and seemed to be
concerting something. At night, after having in vain
tried to sleep, he left the cabin and took a seat on
the prow of the vessel. He had scarcely done so
when he saw a light at some distance, and said to
his companions, “My friends, we are near Trehmiria,
and I bet that is old Yakov spreading his nets.”
The two men did not reply, and Semenov continued
“By God, if the old fisherman’s nets attracted fishes
as well as the eyes of Nadiejda did the lancers of
Archanguelk, he would be rich in a short time.”
Hardly had he spoken these words when he was
struck in the back with a knife. He tried to turn
round, but was knocked down by his assassins.
He still struggled, but was wounded repeatedly.
He called for assistance, and thought he heard a voice
which replied. He was then thrown into the river.
This was all he remembered, he could not tell how
he got into the bark of Nadiejda. After the wounded
man had given the above deposition, I put to him the
following questions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Have you inflicted military punishment on
Hortinja and Tsaryna?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “You know captain, it is impossible to get
along in the army without making use of the baton;
during the year of my command, Hortinja was beaten
nine or ten times, and Tsaryna from forty to fifty, but
I never ordered more than a hundred blows of the
baton at once; so that the officers of the regiment
laughed at my moderation, and called me scholar,
and French officer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Have you not excited the jealousy of some
comrade?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “Not that I am aware of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Were you not acquainted with this Nadiejda
who saved your life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I knew her to be the most beautiful girl of
Trehmiria, and of irreproachable virtue; my lancers
told me this, Hortinja one of the first. I could not
hope to have her for a mistress—and for a wife.⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “That is sufficient. Knew you not that Hortinja
paid his court to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I did not; all the lancers found her beautiful
and attractive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Do you suffer much from your wounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “No, captain, I feel much better, and hope I
shall soon be well; the guilty man’s hand struck
feebly, therefore I hope he will not be punished severely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus closed the examination of Semenov. I then
proceeded to that of the quarter-master Hortinja.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ivanovitch Hortinja was born in 1787 in the
city of Smolensk—entered the army in 1806 in which
he remained thirty-two years and a half—was quarter-master
15 years and four months. He has made
eighteen campaigns, been engaged in forty-nine battles,
and a hundred and thirty-seven combats—has
received the cross of Saint George, and five medals.
He left the service in the month of October 1838.
His discharge and certificates give him a very high
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “What cause had you for disliking Cornet
Semenov?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “Not any. I always found him good and kind
as a father. I have said so to my soldiers. We had
no better officer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “And what then caused you to commit so
abominable a crime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “O father! (a common expression of the Russian
soldier) my crime is abominable, but harken, I
will tell you every thing. I, an old man—having
attained my fiftieth year, I loved for the first time—a
child—this Nadiejda; I loved her as our fathers
loved the glorious empress Catharine (here he made
the sign of the cross.) I was quarter-master, and
had saved something—she was a poor peasant slave,
I wished to marry her, and offered to buy her of her
master Count Strogonof—I was to pay him 500 roubles.
Her father consented to it, but she refused me
disdainfully, without my being able to comprehend
why. In the mean time Tsaryna came to see me, and
said, thou art sorrowful comrade, but thou should’st
not be so. Nadiejda is the mistress of the cornet;
she is almost always at the house where he lodges;
this is well known—thou only appearest to doubt it.
My heart died within me at these words—my head
turned round, but I said nothing, for the Cornet
Semenov was my officer. I began to watch Nadiejda
closely, and I saw that she did often go to the house
where he lodged. I thought not then of revenge.
It was at this time that the cornet gave in his resignation,
and returned to Kostroma. I then saw the
tears of Nadiejda. I saw that grief undermined her
health and tarnished the lustre of her cheek, but I
loved her still. A year passed thus—I repeated my
offer of marriage, she refused me again, and this time
she told me she loved young Semenov, and swore
she would never marry any one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this time Tsaryna became my friend and confidant;
he represented the cornet as the seducer of this
young girl, and I resolved to avenge her. I obtained
my discharge—he, his leave of absence, and we went
to Kostroma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The kind reception the cornet gave us, joined to
his confidence and frankness, disarmed me, and I
determined to abandon my criminal project. Things
were in this state, when young Semenov resolved to
go to Astracan. Tsaryna requested that he might
fill the place of the second sailor, and his request
was complied with. The evening before our departure
he spoke to me of our old project—I was angry—he
praised the beauty of Nadiejda—spoke to me of
her misfortune—of my shame; I said nothing, but
God only knows what infernal tortures my poor
heart sustained; (here he paused a moment in great
emotion) we set out; on the second day of our navigation,
the first sailor and the servant were taken
sick, but as truly as I pray God to save my soul and
pardon my crime, I am ignorant of the cause of their
malady. I advised the cornet to employ another
sailor, but he thought it unnecessary, for the navigation
was easy and the current rapid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tsaryna was constantly speaking to me of Nadiejda;
when we came in sight of the village of Trehmiria I
was moved, troubled, and when the cornet spoke of
her I was no longer master of myself, I drew my
knife and struck him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Did you strike him once, or several times?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I do not know, I had lost my reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Did Tsaryna aid you to commit the crime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I cannot tell, I only remember that he cried
out. Some one is coming! a bark, a bark!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “And what did you do then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I was furious, desperate, distracted. When
the day dawned, I saw the shores, the river, but I
saw neither the cornet, nor the village of Trehmiria.
I wished to throw myself into the water, but had not
sufficient energy, and suffered myself to be persuaded
to live, and seek my safety in flight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “When you arrived at Rybinsk, how did you
manage to sell your cargo so quickly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I knew Jerome Smilabej, and to him I confided
my crime. He consented to save us, provided
we abandoned the cargo to him, and he promised to
arrange every thing for us, and conduct us to a place
of safety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Why didst thou attack me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I had promised the Armenian in case of unforeseen
danger to defend his life as my own. The
moment of danger had come, and I fulfilled my
promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Thou sayest that Tsaryna urged thee to commit
crime, and aided thee to execute it—that the
Armenian protected criminals, and appropriated to
himself wealth which did not belong to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I neither denounce nor accuse any one. I
have spoken the truth. I seek not to deny my crime
nor to cast the consequences upon others. I am a
great criminal!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>EXAMINATION OF PIERRE ALEXIECIVITCH TSARYNA, SON OF A CITIZEN OF KOSTROMA.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>He is thirty-two years of age; entered the military
service in 1828 as a recruit in the lancers of Archanguelk.
He denies any participation in the crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Yet you were the first to tell the quarter-master
Hortinja that a great intimacy existed between
the Cornet Semenov and the girl Nadiejda.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I was joking when I said Semenov and
Nadiejda were too intimate. The quarter-master
was wicked as the devil; he pounded our very
bones with the baton. I revenged myself by contradicting
his ridiculous passion for a girl young
enough to be his grand-daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Why did you rejoin Hortinja at Kostroma?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I met him there by chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “And why did you choose to return at the time
that Semenov was going to Rybinsk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “In order to save my money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Why did you give to the servant of Semenov,
and to the first sailor, a poison, which produced cholic
and vomiting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “They were very fond of brandy—they were
like a cask without bottom; to play them a trick I
put snuff into the liquor: is it my fault they have
such delicate stomachs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Why did you provoke Hortinja to assassinate
the cornet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “I did not. The quarter-master is subject to
visions, he dreams so many other things, that he may
have dreamed that also.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Why, then, did you not defend him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “The cornet was in citizen’s dress, the quarter-master
in uniform, and I am a soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “That the soldier must respect the uniform
more than the citizen’s dress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Why did you throw the cornet into the
water?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “To save him from the fury of the quarter-master.
I also saw a boat coming towards us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “Why did you apprize Hortinja of its coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “From joy that I could save the cornet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Q. “And why did you not denounce the crime of
Hortinja when you arrived at Rybinsk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>R. “Because I am a soldier, and he is a quarter-master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All my questions, all my expedients, the bastinado
included, drew no other confession from him.
Confronted with Hortinja, he replied to his indignation
by sneers; in the presence of soldiers who had
heard his provocations he denied them: only at the
sight of Nadiejda did he turn pale, grind his teeth,
and reply nothing, absolutely nothing!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>DEPOSITION OF NADIEJDA YAKOVLEVNA.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Nadiejda Yakovlevna is twenty-one years of age.
She confessed frankly that she had loved, and still
loved passionately the cornet Semenov, but assured
me that no intimacy had existed between them, and
that the cornet was even ignorant of the passion he
had inspired. She said the soldier Tsaryna had paid
his court to her, and not being able to obtain her love
had sworn to her that he would revenge himself upon
the one who had obtained it. At first his suspicions
rested on Hortinja, and he said he would soon get
rid of the old rascal. Some time after he came to her
and said, “Harken, Nadiejda! be mine, or I swear
by St. Nicholas thou shalt witness the death of Semenov.”
She cared little for his threats, knowing
him to be a coward. About this time the cornet left
Trehmiria. Tsaryna renewed his declarations, but
still without success. Before setting out for Kostroma,
he said, “The old one will do what I have
threatened; before I return I will be revenged, I
swear it by St. Nicholas.” She had never heard
Hortinja threaten the life of the cornet; he was sad
and melancholy—he even wept, but he was a man incapable
of committing a crime unless provoked to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is her account of the night in which she saved
the cornet:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had a presentiment which oppressed my heart;
before I lay down I found a cat upon my bed. A
bad sign! As soon as I fell asleep I had horrible
dreams. I awoke and cried out, ‘Wo to me!’
My father then ordered me to go upon the Volga and
draw away the nets; there I heard cries, and thought
I recognised the voice of Semenov. It was more
than a year since I had seen him, and I knew him in
spite of the obscurity. I rowed towards his boat,
and as I neared it, I heard the splash of a body
thrown into the water. Fortunately, I was close by
and succeeded in drawing him out of the river. It
was Semenov.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inquiry was completed by a few other declarations
of less consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Armenian merchant tried to excuse himself,
and said that he endeavored to save the two men
in order that they might have time for repentance.
In other things he confirmed what Hortinja had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fisherman Yakov gave an account of the manner
in which Tsaryna had threatened him, because
he would not give him his daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inquiry terminated on the thirteenth of May,
and the depositions were on the same day laid before
the criminal tribunal of Novogorod by the captain
Isprawnik.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the twenty-ninth of May the tribunal pronounced
the decree which condemns:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ivanovitch Hortinja to perpetual banishment
in Siberia, and ten years labor in the mines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jerome Smilabej, Armenian merchant, to one year
and six days imprisonment, a fine of one thousand
rubles, and the costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pierre A. Tsaryna, being a soldier, was sent before
the military tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fourth of June, the military tribunal of the
first corps of the army, assembled at Novogorod,
condemned Pierre A. Tsaryna to pass three times
through the rods of a squadron, and afterwards to be
transported to Siberia, where he must labor in the
mines for the rest of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These decrees have been submitted to the emperor,
and confirmed by him with this change: Hortinja
is perpetually banished, but will not be obliged
to labor in the mines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third of June, the decree was executed on
Pierre A. Tsaryna, who was so severely beaten that
there is little hope of his recovery; he has been
taken to the hospital of Novogorod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>L’Abeille du Nord, a Russian journal of St. Petersburg,
reached us at the same time with the letter of
our correspondent. It gives an account of this affair,
and also adds that the emperor has deigned to
decorate the girl Nadiejda with a medal of gold on
the ribbon of Saint Waldimir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Cornet Semenov married Nadiejda Yakovlevna
as soon as the trial was concluded.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The lamp of ghastly heath and rill,</p>
<p class='line0'>As if like some malignant star</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;’Twould make them all more ghastly still.</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;ROSANI.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Fit time!”—he cried with quivering brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>Tale such as mine was uttered now;</p>
<p class='line0'>When all the elements are stirred</p>
<p class='line0'>To hear a spirit’s fearful word.</p>
<p class='line0'>Let lightnings flash—let thunders roll,</p>
<p class='line0'>What terrors have they for the soul</p>
<p class='line0'>That flees the golden eye of day,</p>
<p class='line0'>And hates its beams e’en more than they!</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ve revell’d in their light before</p>
<p class='line0'>In many a sea, on many a shore⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>On many a rock—on many a deck⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes! challenged them amid the wreck⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>When they and the remorseless sea</p>
<p class='line0'>Seem’d smiling on my agony.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yet! have I loved a milder glow</p>
<p class='line0'>Than yonder lurid fires bestow:</p>
<p class='line0'>There was a moment! glorious time!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When I, amid my native bow’rs,</p>
<p class='line0'>Unmoved by care—unsoiled by crime⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Would watch the sunshine beam for hours;</p>
<p class='line0'>It glowed of my own self a part,</p>
<p class='line0'>For all was sunshine in the heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which seemed an angel who had left,</p>
<p class='line0'>He knew not how, the stainless blue,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And smiled, so long of light bereft,</p>
<p class='line0'>To find an angel wandering, too.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But when I saw the bannered storm⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like giant rousing from his sleep⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Uplift o’er heaven his awful form,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And from the thunder-chamber sweep</p>
<p class='line0'>To his dread bridal with the flame</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Before their altar of the cloud,</p>
<p class='line0'>While all his minstrel-tempests came</p>
<p class='line0'>Around the shrine, in terror bowed,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ve smiled with other smile than this,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For then, I, leaping from the sod,</p>
<p class='line0'>Saw, in their rude but meaning bliss,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The wondrous glory of a God:⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes! e’en when others quailed to see</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The red volcano light our clime,</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ve joyed, for in its ministry</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I only saw a torch sublime,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lighting with its tremendous glare</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The glorious pages of His book,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which men might read if they would dare</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Upon those awful leaves to look.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Like thee I joyed alone to range</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Amid the beautiful and bright,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A thing like them of love and light⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Like thee my spirit had its change.</p>
<p class='line0'>The spell was wove! It thundered out</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In many a wild and bitter curse⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>And thenceforth I was hurl’d about</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Hopeless amid the universe.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Long years! oh! how your shadows press</p>
<p class='line0'>My brow in very weariness:</p>
<p class='line0'>Here! here ye stretch and ever gloom</p>
<p class='line0'>Like funeral-foliage of the tomb,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose leaves—the favorites of pain</p>
<p class='line0'>Must ever life from sorrow gain.</p>
<p class='line0'>Long years! long years! I feel again</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Your star-eyed hopes around me glow</p>
<p class='line0'>Bright as the plumage of a train</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of pilgrim-angels furled below.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>We are together: Ila, see</p>
<p class='line0'>The light of heaven’s own heraldry⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>And hark!—the evening breeze is here;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;His silver lips no longer mute,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>He breathes—a minstrel-worshipper⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>An avè from his leafy lute:</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall we not join him? Dearest, press</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Thy lip to mine, while, as of old,</p>
<p class='line0'>We hear with love’s sweet tenderness</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That glorious vesper music rolled.</p>
<p class='line0'>We are together in those bowers</p>
<p class='line0'>Glad as the rosy-footed hours</p>
<p class='line0'>And all as pure.—I see her now</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A creature less of earth than skies,</p>
<p class='line0'>With day’s pure sunshine on her brow</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And heaven’s own midnight in her eyes.</p>
<p class='line0'>And thus we trod the path of life,</p>
<p class='line0'>Without nor cloud, nor grief, nor strife⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Like pensile stars whose golden light</p>
<p class='line0'>Meets on the sable bridge of night</p>
<p class='line0'>And glows with such a wedded beam</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In calm or stormy weather,</p>
<p class='line0'>That men when looking upwards deem</p>
<p class='line0'>They are but one, for thus they seem,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;So close they shine together.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ha! whence this change? My Ila! why</p>
<p class='line0'>That icy mien and tearful eye?</p>
<p class='line0'>No more for me thou cullest the flow’r;⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>No more with me thou seekest the bow’r;⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>No more thy sweet lips press my own;⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;No more thy warm hands link with mine,</p>
<p class='line0'>When Daylight, stooping from his throne,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Has furl’d his wing by evening’s shrine.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She answered not! yet sorrow there</p>
<p class='line0'>Has held a bridal with despair,</p>
<p class='line0'>And pale her cheek as if with wo</p>
<p class='line0'>Which none but she must ever know.</p>
<p class='line0'>In vain I questioned—her reply</p>
<p class='line0'>A sad reproachfulness of eye,</p>
<p class='line0'>So firm yet tender in its look,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;It ever, sorrowing, seemed to say</p>
<p class='line0'>“Why torture me!”—I could not brook</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Such gaze, but gladly turned away,</p>
<p class='line0'>Leaving my Ila to her mood</p>
<p class='line0'>In our old castle’s solitude.</p>
<p class='line0'>Days rolled away!—And who art thou</p>
<p class='line0'>With princely step and lofty brow?</p>
<p class='line0'>What dost thou here within our halls,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sir knight! unwelcome to these walls?</p>
<p class='line0'>Days roll’d away!—I sought my sire;</p>
<p class='line0'>He met me but with glance of ire,</p>
<p class='line0'>And freezing mystery of air,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which seemed to say—“Ila?—beware!”</p>
<p class='line0'>And then he cried, “away! away!</p>
<p class='line0'>Mad boy, she weds the knight to-day!”</p>
<p class='line0'>I spoke not; slowly round me came</p>
<p class='line0'>A wavering sheet of cloud and flame,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which seem’d to sear my very brain:</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;How long ’twas thus I cannot say,</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor when I woke to life again.</p>
<p class='line0'>They called me mad: I heard the chain</p>
<p class='line0'>Clanking around my limbs, and near</p>
<p class='line0'>The hum of voices meet my ear,</p>
<p class='line0'>And eyes amid the darkness shone</p>
<p class='line0'>So bright, so angry and so lone⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Methought they were the eyes of those</p>
<p class='line0'>Whom men have named their demon-foes,</p>
<p class='line0'>Drawing a life from human woes.</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes! I was mad, and in my strength</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I spurned the dungeon’s hated ground,</p>
<p class='line0'>Hurled from my limbs the chain, at length,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And thus my birth-right freedom found.</p>
<p class='line0'>I saw the glorious stars again⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Once more I gazed upon the main</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose billows e’en in boyhood were</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My playmates, when their crested forms</p>
<p class='line0'>Rushed up like ministers of Fear</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Amid their temple of the storms.</p>
<p class='line0'>Once more I heard the Ocean’s shock</p>
<p class='line0'>Against the castellated rock;</p>
<p class='line0'>And saw, oh! gallant, blessed sight!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My barque along the heaving tide,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like lover resting through the night</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Upon the bosom of his bride.</p>
<p class='line0'>The sail’s unfurl’d! How free! How brave!</p>
<p class='line0'>On! on my vessel, o’er the wave!</p>
<p class='line0'>The night-winds kiss thee, as in joy</p>
<p class='line0'>To meet once more their ocean-boy.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! I had loved thee, glorious sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And oft thy waters laved my brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>But never have I gazed on thee</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With such a bounding heart as now.</p>
<p class='line0'>Roll on! Roll on! thy dark blue foam</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall henceforth be to me a home.</p>
<p class='line0'>For days I skimmed the ocean blue,</p>
<p class='line0'>And deeper still my gladness grew;</p>
<p class='line0'>And oft my joy was uttered out</p>
<p class='line0'>To heaven in that delirious shout</p>
<p class='line0'>Which only he can swell whose life</p>
<p class='line0'>Is passed amid the ocean’s strife.</p>
<p class='line0'>And others soon around me came;</p>
<p class='line0'>And men soon shook before my name.</p>
<p class='line0'>What trophies glittered on our deck,</p>
<p class='line0'>How foemen sank with many a wreck,</p>
<p class='line0'>Let that old ocean’s caverns tell,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>In sooth our spirits loved them well⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>They lay beneath us like a spell.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A sail! How looks she in the dark?</p>
<p class='line0'>“Bravely! She is a royal barque!”</p>
<p class='line0'>Give thanks! Hurrah! I ween the wave</p>
<p class='line0'>Before the morn shall be her grave!</p>
<p class='line0'>Out with the guns!—“Ho, sir! she veers!⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Again! again! Hurrah! she nears!”</p>
<p class='line0'>She came so nigh, that we could see</p>
<p class='line0'>The pilot’s lonely ministry.</p>
<p class='line0'>Sudden as lightning from its lair</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Fire glowed around her deck;⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Ha! ship, that rode so proudly there⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Thou art a very wreck!</p>
<p class='line0'>Once more the frowning guns were out;</p>
<p class='line0'>Their thunder told in shriek and shout!</p>
<p class='line0'>“The barque’s on fire!”—with one wild cry!</p>
<p class='line0'>That pierced the very wave and sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Her crew leaped in the tide;</p>
<p class='line0'>But as she heavily floated by⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! God what met my startled eye?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The chieftain and his bride!</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes, he and Ila shrined in flame</p>
<p class='line0'>Were wildly calling on my name:⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>At one mad bound I cleared my deck,</p>
<p class='line0'>And stood upon that burning wreck:</p>
<p class='line0'>Through flame and smoke I fearless flew!</p>
<p class='line0'>A moment—I have reached the two!</p>
<p class='line0'>I grasped him! and the lurid wave</p>
<p class='line0'>Revenged me well—it was his grave.</p>
<p class='line0'>I bore her in my arms—the smoke</p>
<p class='line0'>And flame in vain around me broke⁠,—</p>
<p class='line0'>I felt them curling o’er my brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>As fierce they swept from stern to plow;⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>I struggled on!—one effort more⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I leaped upon my vessel’s side!</p>
<p class='line0'>Thank God! the final strife was o’er,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And I had won my ocean-bride!</p>
<p class='line0'>In one dread shock the crackling mast</p>
<p class='line0'>Came thundering down beneath the blast:⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The flaming wreck slow drives away⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Dim and more dim we marked the ray;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And now unloosing every sail⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>We feel our vessel, like a steed</p>
<p class='line0'>Gladdening to serve his rider’s need,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Dart out before the gale.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Slowly the thrill of feeling came</p>
<p class='line0'>Along my Ila’s pallid frame;</p>
<p class='line0'>I marked the rising crimson swell</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon the cheek I loved too well,</p>
<p class='line0'>And heard, how joyously! the sigh</p>
<p class='line0'>Which told me that she could not die,</p>
<p class='line0'>At least not then:—she rose at last;</p>
<p class='line0'>One piercing look around she cast,</p>
<p class='line0'>And shrieked!—her memory, ah! too soon</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Had lighted up those scenes of old,</p>
<p class='line0'>When I, beneath far different moon</p>
<p class='line0'>Than that which brightly rose aboon,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My love so passionately told.</p>
<p class='line0'>She spake not still; but day by day</p>
<p class='line0'>I saw her calmly sink away</p>
<p class='line0'>Like some sweet flower or rainbow-form</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose life is withered by the storm.</p>
<p class='line0'>But when I saw her pallid lips</p>
<p class='line0'>Darkling beneath the death-eclipse,</p>
<p class='line0'>She waved me to her side and said⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>I cannot speak her words—the dead</p>
<p class='line0'>Would stir within their very tomb</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To hear such tale!—Enough! she died,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I beheld in that sea-room</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A sister in my ocean-bride.</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! how I blessed the God above,</p>
<p class='line0'>That she went down unsoiled by love</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose reckless and unholy fire</p>
<p class='line0'>Springs from the heart of low desire.</p>
<p class='line0'>My sire had framed a cunning tale</p>
<p class='line0'>—To shroud his crime, and this the baal!</p>
<p class='line0'>He brought her to our castle’s hall⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Saying she was a homeless child,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whom he had found beneath the wall</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In all her orphan-freedom wild.</p>
<p class='line0'>Of that she told me, on the day</p>
<p class='line0'>She died, thus much I dared to say.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And Ila sleeps within the wave,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And round her peaceful ocean-tomb</p>
<p class='line0'>The pale flowers of the coral-grave</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In all their quiet beauty bloom.</p>
<p class='line0'>Sleep on! sleep on in that deep rest⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou of the stainless brow and breast,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! holy as the stars that shine</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In all their seraph splendor set,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like torches of a templed-shrine</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In midnight’s azure coronet.</p>
<p class='line0'>She was avenged! That very hour</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In which the tide received her form,</p>
<p class='line0'>The deep-blue sky began to lour</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Beneath the scowling of the storm;</p>
<p class='line0'>And soon the thunder, vast and dark,</p>
<p class='line0'>Shook his red arm above our barque,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose deck deserted—sails all rent</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And loose around the shivered mast,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like reeling clouds were blindly sent</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Before the fury of the blast.</p>
<p class='line0'>“The boats! the boats!”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;They’re riding well</p>
<p class='line0'>Along that billow’s crested swell.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Save! save yourselves,” I sternly cried,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Undaunted on the plunging deck,</p>
<p class='line0'>“I go to seek my ocean-bride,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But comrades ye must leave the wreck!”</p>
<p class='line0'>An instant—they were safe! and I</p>
<p class='line0'>Alone stood challenging the sky</p>
<p class='line0'>And rolling waves.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;With fearless form</p>
<p class='line0'>I dared the spirit of the storm:</p>
<p class='line0'>His red lips answered me—the flame</p>
<p class='line0'>Leaped burning through my blackened frame!—</p>
<p class='line0'>And I was here.—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“No more! No more!”</p>
<p class='line0'>He cried, “that agony was o’er:⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>But this!”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He darkly gazed around,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then quivering sank upon the ground;</p>
<p class='line0'>And Lorro on his dread distress</p>
<p class='line0'>Gazed sorrowing—mute and motionless.</p>

<p class='line0'>The tempest with his train has fled,</p>

<div><h1><a id='ware'></a>MRS. WARE’S POEMS.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Averse, as we have declared ourselves, to any severe
criticisms upon the productions of female poets,
we are constrained, in the case before us, to speak
with a plainness, savoring less of gallantry than
truth. If only “<span class='it'>some</span> female errors” fell to the lot
of Mrs. <span class='sc'>Katharine Augusta Ware</span>, we might,
perhaps, “look in her face” and “forget them all;”
but so many are the faults of which she is guilty, that
she must have a face as beautiful as Raphael’s
Fornarina, to cause us to forget or forgive a tithe of
the number. The lady, however, is neither beautiful
nor juvenile; she goes so far in her preface as to
confess that she cannot plead “<span class='it'>youthful</span> diffidence”
for her indiscretion in writing and publishing a volume
of verses. That she is not beautiful, we state
on positive intelligence. On this score, therefore,
her sins of metrical commission cannot be pardoned
any more than because of her juvenility—an excuse
which she so magnanimously disclaims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the second leaf of Mrs. Ware’s book, which is
not really as well as figuratively <span class='it'>blank</span>, we perceive,
paraded in capital letters, the words “<span class='sc'>Copyright
secured in America</span>.” Now, if the copyright has
in fact been secured in America; if it has been
entered at the office of the District Clerk of New
York or of any other State, as the law directs, it
strikes us that the dollar, charged as a fee in such
cases, has been absurdly and ridiculously thrown
away. The proceeding was altogether supererogatory.
Booksellers are not particularly partial to
publishing collections of poetry at the best; but that
any one of them should be so insane as to re-publish
a farrago like this, to enter into rivalry and competition
for such a cause, is an hypothesis which never
could have been engendered, except in the brain of
a rhymster, dizzy with self-conceit. From the fact,
however, of a copyright having been secured in
America, we are well assured that the author is an
American; even this was unnecessary, because Mrs.
<span class='sc'>Katharine Augusta Ware</span> has, in times past,
written her name to so many patches of poetry, that
it is not unfamiliar to pains-taking readers, at least
on our side of the water. She first made herself
known to the literary world here as the Editor of
a monthly magazine, exquisitely christened “The
Bower of Taste.” That any work, with so Rosa-Matildaish
a title, could have existed for a year was
marvellous; still more marvellous was it, that it survived
the merciless visitings of the Muse of Mrs.
Ware. With the failure of this undertaking, her
literary biography, brief as the posy of a ring, would
terminate, were it not for the fact that, during some
four years past, she has resided in England, and
manufactured, to order, occasional lyrics for the
Liverpool Newspapers. By some fatuity, which
she has provokingly left unexplained, in a preface
written in the worst possible taste, she has been impelled
to the perpetration of the volume before us.
But, previous to exemplifications of its component
properties, let us give the preface entire, by way of
showing how very unlike ladies, and how very foolishly,
feminine bards can behave on paper. If our
readers of both sexes do not laugh at the following
outbreak of egotism and vanity, they are less easily
amused than we conjecture.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>COURTEOUS READER,</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to write a <span class='sc'>Preface</span>, if I could.—Such
an ample field is afforded, for appealing to the sympathy
and generosity of the “Liberal Public.” Such
emphatic words as “youthful diffidence,” “consciousness
of errors,” “request of friends,” “leisure
hours,” “relief in solitude,”—all these once attracted
my delighted attention, and I resolved, if <span class='it'>I</span> ever
should write a book, to present therewith a very
sentimental Preface. But upon this subject my
opinions are changed. Negatively speaking of
my volume—“youthful diffidence” I cannot plead;
“consciousness of errors,” I might, which I own I
have had time to correct. I do not publish at the
“request of friends,” for no friends, to my knowledge,
were ever particularly anxious for such an
event. Nor for the amusement of my “leisure
hours,” for, since my remembrance, I never had
any. Nor as a “relief in solitude,” for I am never
alone. And permit me to add, not for gold, for my
muse will never become a Crœsus. Lastly, not for
Fame, for light is my regard for her vain breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A <span class='sc'>Preface</span> is an article which I am by no means
prepared to attempt, being apprehensive that my
labors might terminate like those of a certain venerable
individual, of spelling-book celebrity, who, in
companionship with his son, and a long-eared fellow-traveller,
by his anxiety to please everybody, found,
to his mortification, that he could please nobody.
Now, with the very moderate desire of pleasing
somebody, I have determined to write no preface to
my book, because I am not prepared to make a single
fashionable apology for its publication. At the
present era of book-making, all prefatory introductions
seem to be disregarded as superfluous by the
reading community, except to works of deep erudition,
or on subjects which may require preliminary
elucidations from the author. All others are merely
glanced over like the “programme of an entertainment,”
or a “bill of the play,” and obtain no further
notice. Scarcely one reader out of ten has the least
interest or curiosity to learn what motive induced the
author to write the volume, which he has either
bought or borrowed for his entertainment. He certainly
has a right to expect it will contain some
matter either to improve, inform, or amuse the mind.
If disappointed, no apology, however gracefully
made, will effect a change in his opinion; and the
author may expect to receive the same compliment
which a certain learned doctor (more famed for
candor than politeness) once paid to his delinquent
pupil, who made an elaborate apology for his errors,
that he who was good at making “a handsome
apology, was generally good for nothing else.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Thine respectfully,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>K. A. W.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Since we have suffered our author to speak for
herself, nobody can accuse us of unfairness, since
that captious gentleman, Nobody, is not obliged to
think as we do, but can, if he so pleases, pronounce
Mrs. Katharine Augusta Ware to be the most modest,
unassuming, charming pilgrim, that ever journeyed
to the fountain of Helicon, or toiled up the steeps of
Parnassus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have, in our time, been constrained by our
vocation, to spell out a good many pieces of bombast;
but we can safely say that, in our serious
belief, no rhetorician was ever better furnished with
an illustration for that not very rare quality of style,
than in the effusion with which we begin to be
overwhelmed on page one, under the imposing title
“The Power of the Passions.” We had thought
of turning the whole into prose, but as we have not
the space to spare, and the readers can easily do it
for themselves, whenever we shall have occasion to
cite a passage, we content ourselves with a cursory
description, and no very acute analysis, since the
philosophy is quite as incomprehensible as the lines
are vapid, and the ideas commonplace. <span class='it'>Imprimis</span>,
we are favored with the strikingly novel information
that there was a time, a good while ago, when man
stood in God’s own image communing with angels in
a bower,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“When first creation dawned upon his view.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This fair world, we are next agreeably astonished to
learn, was given to man by high Omnipotence. At
this interesting period, Creation owned her Lord,
and all that moved confessed his reign, and the
forest monarch bowed down before him, beside the
young lamb; (bah!) moreover, birds hailed the rising
day, and there were flowers and trees and fruits
<span class='it'>cum multis aliis</span> of the sort.</p>

<p class='line0'>All <span class='sc'>Eden</span> brightened with a richer glow!</p>
<p class='line0'>Led by the hand of <span class='sc'>Deity</span>, she came</p>
<p class='line0'>To dwell in kind companionship with man,</p>
<p class='line0'>A sharer of his pleasures and his toils,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which nature’s genial bosom richly paid:</p>
<p class='line0'>Love, joy, and harmony, and peace, were there⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>God saw his glorious work, and it was good.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These lines are cited, because they are the only
good ones in the poem, and because it occurs to us
that we have seen something rather like them in the
works of a respectable poet of the middle ages—one
Milton. In the remainder of the effusion, Mrs. Ware
is unquestionably original.</p>

<p class='line0'>Around fair Wisdom’s consecrated Tree.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Eat, woman, eat—ye shall <span class='it'>not</span> surely die!”</p>
<p class='line0'>Thus spake the tempter of mankind. <span class='it'>They ate</span>⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>A sudden darkness gathered o’er the sky.</p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Wild raged the storm, earth’s firm foundations shook,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>While ocean trembled from her deepest cells;</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Blue, livid lightnings flashed with lurid glare,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>Wreathing in flames the blackened arch of heaven;</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The four verses we have italicised are fiercely
grand; more terrible than any we ever saw, except
those by which they are succeeded. After the
thunder-clap, lions roared, tigers yelled, hyenas
cried, wolves howled, leviathans drifted ashore, birds
of ill omen shrieked, and there was a dreadful rumpus
in general among beasts, such as are usually to
be seen in a Zoological Garden. The Arch-Enemy
chuckles over this sport, rives his chain, and stalks
over the globe, taking the precaution, however, to
veil his hideous form and smile demoniac, (why, we
cannot well perceive,) and finally speaks. His observations
are left to the ingenuity of the reader; but
he had no sooner “concluded his remarks,” than</p>

<p class='noindent'>These we suppose are the Passions, mentioned in
the title. Taking them as they are introduced, they
are the most outrageous set of ill-behaved monsters
that ever were seen, and are as dissimilar to those
polite entities, classified under the same names, and
said by the Fourrierists to be easily subjected to the
domination of reason and the affections, as can well
be imagined. It must be noted, however, that Mrs.
Ware is more original in the individuals she recommends
to our attention as the Passions, than she is
in her figures of speech.</p>

which is so clearly applicable to the “divine Fanny

<p class='noindent'>And we cease; but not altogether. Cry not, oh
reader, with king-killing Macbeth, “hold, enough!”
till we shall have at least ferreted out some stanzas
worth commendation, in the one hundred and forty
“mortal pages,” which drag their slow length after
“The Power of the Passions”—which title, we beg
leave to suggest, should be changed to the somewhat
Hibernian one of “A Power of Passions,” which
would be more expressive of the number of new
ones “making their first appearance on any stage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the gross errors of persons who deem themselves
poets, but are not—who make verses, to which
neither gods, men nor columns can yield applause—are
displayed, not only in the effusion which we
have too tenderly handled, but in most of the remaining
rubbish of metre, which this mistaken lady has
raked together and piled up for the diversion of the
public in England. It is said of those, who make
constant efforts to utter happy repartees and smart
jokes, that it would be a wonder if they did not now
and then stumble upon a clever hit. The remark
may with truth be applied to the indefatigable concoctor
of rhymes. Desperate must be his condition,
if, at large intervals, good couplets did not slip from
his pen. Poor as most of Mrs. Ware’s poems are,
stanzas are scattered through them which are really
beautiful, and have the air of being in their present
position by mistake. Occasionally, also, when the
subject is dictated by feeling; when the thoughts
well from the heart, and are like those which are
entertained by the author in common with other
people of sensibility; when she does not strive to be
very fine, very grand and very fascinating, her lines
run smoothly and gracefully along. Take as a favorable
example of her versification one stanza, from a
poem called “Diamond Island,” which, as we are
told, is a delightful little island, situated in Lake
George, and well known to the Northern tourists for
its picturesque beauty, and the brilliant crystals to
be found on its shores:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have faithfully performed our unpleasant duty
in the foregoing criticism. A high standard has
been set up by us, and it must be defended. Censure
is far less agreeable to us than commendation;
but the last would be wholly valueless, when flowing
from our pen, were we always to withhold the
first. Poetry, to be acceptable, must have higher
qualities than those which the mere habit and practice
of writing confers. A man may play very well
on the piano and not be a musician; he may sketch
very well and not be a painter; he may model very
well and have no just claim to be called a sculptor.
The maker of graceful stanzas is not a poet; he is
at best entitled only to be called a person of accomplishments.
He is inexcusable when he brings himself
prominently before the public and claims to be
ranked among artists. Women, more than men,
cultivate their powers of taste. We know many of
the sex who not only sing and sketch, but write very
nice verses. They would, however, shrink from
publicity with a sensitive dread of ridicule. For the
sake of a pure literature this apprehension should be
kept alive by an occasional article, like the one
which we have felt ourselves impelled to present on
the effusions of Mrs. <span class='sc'>Katharine Augusta Ware</span>.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE VENTILATOR.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was one of the most sultry days of an intensely
hot summer, the thermometer stood at eighty-five in
the shade, every thing was parched with fervent
heat, and, as if to show their powers of endurance,
half the world, leaving the quiet comfort of luxurious
homes, were inhaling the close and unhealthful atmosphere
of a crowded watering-place. Cecil Forrester
had mingled with the throng, and, bidding
adieu to his father’s beautiful country-seat, where
the murmur of a rushing stream mingled its cool
refreshing sound with the whisper of the summer
breeze, had obtained, for a certain consideration,
the privilege of occupying an apartment, some eight
feet by ten, in the great hotel which stretches its
huge length along the sands at ——. But Cecil
had other motives than simple obedience to the dictates
of fashion. He was in love, deeply and earnestly
in love, and the lady on whom he had bestowed
his affections seemed to him one of those exquisite
creatures, equally well fitted to be the gem of a ball-room
or the ornament of domestic life. He had met
her in the sequestered village of Norwood, whither
he repaired every summer to visit a favorite sister,
and where the lovely Miss Oriel had come to repair
the ravages which a winter’s dissipation had made
in her fresh complexion. They had enjoyed a flirtation
of the most delightful kind, because it had been
purely sentimental, and such is, after all, the most
agreeable variety of that very common species of
amusement. Laura Oriel had laid aside all her
usual gaiety of apparel, her dress was the very perfection
of elegant simplicity; her raven hair was
braided, without a single ringlet, around her well
turned head, and, in short, nothing could be more
attractive than the city belle so suddenly transformed
into <span class='it'>la jolie paysanne</span> of a country village. Many a
moonlit walk had Cecil Forrester enjoyed with her,
many a beautiful fancy had been pictured out during
their rambles in the summer woods, many a noble
sentiment had been uttered beneath the deep shadow
of the rocky cliff, many a delicate thought had been
evolved amid the beauty and sublimity of nature.
The time passed like a dream. The genial breezes
of flowery June had been exchanged for the fervent
heats of July, and these had again been forgotten in
the more oppressive sultriness of August before their
happiness was disturbed by a single thought of the
future. But Miss Oriel was then obliged to accompany
her mother to ——. It was a most disagreeable
necessity, for she did not love a crowd, and though
her fortune and station in society compelled her to
appear among the multitude, yet she was only happy
in the seclusion of domestic life. But duty to her
only parent was the ruling principle of her existence.
Her mother’s wishes had forced her into society
during the past winter, and now the same irresistible
power drew her to the turbulent scenes of a fashionable
watering-place. Poor thing! she was certainly
to be pitied, and so thought Cecil Forrester. He
was upon the point of expressing his ardent admiration,
and offering his heart and hand to her whose
tender friendship had made him bankrupt in all that
was worthy of her acceptance. But, somehow or
other, no opportunity occurred for any such explanation.
The lady rather avoided those delicious walks
which, though favorable to the growth of affection,
might afford chances for an unseasonable declaration.
So Cecil was only able to inform her of his
intention to meet her at ——, and contented himself,
for the present, with offering her a splendid
copy of Rogers’ Poems, in which he had inscribed
her name in the most delicate of Italian writing, and
where she found, on further examination, the words
“To her who will understand me,” written over the
pretty pastoral poem entitled “The Wish.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>It was certainly a most appropriate and delicately
expressed choice for such a lover of natural beauty
and quiet happiness as Miss Laura Oriel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to return to ——. Mr. Forrester knew that
Miss Oriel was expected to arrive there on a certain
morning, and, as he had gone down several days
previous, he was, of course, on the watch for her.
Most impassioned admirers would have rushed out
to welcome the object of their thoughts at the very
first glimpse of her green veil. But Cecil was no
vulgar lover, his taste was excessively refined, and
for his own sake, no less than out of regard to the
lady’s feelings, he did not choose to behold her in
travelling dishabille after a long and dusty ride. He
therefore contented himself with watching from an
upper window her descent from the stage coach,
and then retired to his apartment until the preparatory
dinner-bell should summon the <span class='it'>élite</span> to the
saloon. As I have said before, the day was excessively
warm, and all the ventilators (which had been
mercifully placed over each door to prevent suffocation)
stood wide open, as if the rooms, like their
heated occupants, were gasping for breath. Cecil,
who had a tolerably correct notion of comfort, had
loosed his boot-straps, unbraced his stays, and flung
himself upon the bed to indulge a pleasant reverie
before he commenced his toilet, when he was suddenly
recalled to the scenes of actual life by the
sound of a well-known voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The apartments to which Miss Oriel and her
mother had been conducted (the privilege of selection
would be a most unheard-of innovation of the
rights of hotel-keepers at such a season) happened
to be immediately opposite to the one already occupied
by Mr. Forrester. The ventilators of both were
open, and, as he heard her voice, he felt a sweet satisfaction
in the thought, that the soft southern breeze
which was cooling his brow also fanned the ringlets
of his beautiful mistress. But really there was no
excuse for his listening to her conversation; it was
most ungentlemanlike, but at the same time, I am
sorry to say, most natural; and though heartily
ashamed of him for so doing, I am obliged to confess
that he paid the closest attention to every word of
their discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long do you want to stay here, Laura?”
said the mother, in that wheezing sort of voice which
belongs to fat, pursy old ladies when over-fatigued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will depend upon circumstances,” was the
short and rather crusty reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know they charge twelve dollars a week,
and every bath is an extra expense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of that? We must risk something in all
speculations, and mine is a pretty safe venture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish we had left Ellen Grey at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t agree with you; we owe her some return
for staying nearly three months with her at Norwood,
and I cannot bear to be under an obligation to
such mighty good sort of people, for they never forget
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But her board will be expensive, and I do not
see why it would not have been as well to invite her
to our house in the winter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t seem to understand my plans, Mamma.
Ellen Grey is pretty, and modest, and sentimental,
and all that; she is just the kind of person to be very
attractive to gentlemen when seen in domestic life,
but she is too timid to appear well in a place like this.
She will scarcely dare to raise her eyes in such a
crowd, and therefore there can be no rivalry between
us. Besides, she has a great deal of taste,
and her assistance at my toilet enables me to dispense
with a dressing maid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot see much force in your argument.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not; what would you say if I tell you
I want her as a foil?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is too pretty to serve such a purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are greatly mistaken; any body would look
well beside an ugly girl, but one must be exceedingly
beautiful to bear a comparison with as pretty a
creature as Ellen Grey. Her delicate complexion,
which is continually suffused with blushes, her fair
hair and blue eyes would appear lovelier any where
else than they will beside me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such beauty as yours requires no foil, Laura.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I choose to employ one, notwithstanding; I have
come here for the express purpose of attracting
Fitzroy Beauchamp, and I mean to neglect nothing,
however trifling, to compass my schemes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will Cecil Forrester say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I succeed, he may say what he pleases. I
mean to play off my present lover against the future
one; and Cecil will be of use to me by exciting the

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how you kept up the farce so long,
Laura; even Ellen thinks you a most exemplary
sentimentalist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it was a pleasant mode of getting rid of time;
nothing sharpens one’s wits like a flirtation with a
real lover—I have learned twenty new stratagems
from my ‘<span class='it'>country practice</span>.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure Mr. Beauchamp is rich?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He drives blood-horses, sports a tiger in livery,
lives at the Astor, drinks wine at $8 a bottle, and,
what is more, pays his bills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you learn this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From very good authority; he is said to have
$200,000 in bank stocks besides a sugar plantation
worth $12,000 per annum, and slaves enough to stock
a colony; so you see he is a prize worth winning.
As for Cecil Forrester, I am sorry he is here, but I
must manage to turn him over to the unsophisticated
little rustic for the present. I do not wish to give
him a downright dismissal, because if I should fail
to secure the millionaire it would be as well to fall
back upon Forrester’s $30,000. The game will be a
difficult one, but the glory of success will be the
greater.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will reap some of the spoils of victory,
Laura, for our legacy is rapidly diminishing, and
when it is gone you know there will be no further
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never fear, Mamma; my stock in trade is very
good—beauty, tact, and five thousand dollars form a
very excellent capital, and I think I can afford to
speculate rather largely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But more than half of the most essential part of
your capital is already gone, and you have not as yet
succeeded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget that I have gained a footing in society
by its expenditure; leave every thing to me, and if
I am not married before next season, then write me
down a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cecil Forrester heard every word of this dialogue.
At its commencement he had started to his feet, and
if any one could have witnessed his gestures and
contortions he would have been deemed a madman.
His face flushed and paled, his eyes dilated with
anger and flashed with contempt, his lip curled in
bitter scorn, and narrowly escaped being bitten
through as he gnashed his teeth in impotent rage;
he clenched his hands, he tore off the turquoise ring
which he had hitherto worn on his little finger as a
<span class='it'>gage d’amitié</span> from the false beauty, and finally, after
exhausting his angry emotions, he flung himself into
a seat, with a calm and determined expression of
countenance which augured ill for some of the
schemes of Miss Laura Oriel.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE DINING-ROOM.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Is there any thing more musical to the ear of the
time-sick lounger at a fashionable watering-place
than the dinner-bell? Talk of the melody of running
streams, the sighing of summer winds, the carol of
forest birds! they may be all very pleasant sounds
in certain moods of the mind, but for a music which
never fails to please, a sound which never falls
wearily upon the senses, a voice which is never
uttered to a listless ear, commend me to that dinner-bell.
The dullest face brightens into something like
intelligence, the most confirmed valetudinarian forgets
all elegant debility, the most intellectual remember
the pressing claims of the physical man, and the
most refined of women venture to look somewhat
interested in the vulgar duty of dining. The saloon
was crowded with company all eager for the summons
which was to transform them into eating
animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray why,” said a gentleman who was somewhat
famous for puns, conundrums and such little
witticisms, preferring as it seemed to shoot the “rats
and mice and such small deer” of literature, because
he could draw a <span class='it'>long</span> rather than a <span class='it'>strong</span> bow;
“Pray,” said he in that half suppressed voice which,
like a theatrical aside, is sure to be distinctly heard
in a crowd, “why is this saloon like the President’s
levee? do ye give it up? why it is filled with a
crowd of <span class='it'>hungry expectants</span>! ha! ha! ha!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The joke would have been excellent as an after
dinner speech, but the audacity of uttering an idle
jest while so many persons were keenly alive to one
of the sufferings of frail humanity, was very properly
punished. No body laughed, and, to his infinite regret,
the great Mr. —— saw that he had wasted
his wit. The first stroke of the second bell brought
all to their feet, as suddenly as if they had been subjected
to the power of a galvanic battery. Cecil
Forrester, attired with unusual care, all the lurking
dandyism of his character fully but not offensively
displayed, had been one of the first in the saloon, determined
to give Miss Oriel a lesson in indifference.
But she did not appear, and, as the band struck up a
march, the usual signal for deploying into the dining-room,
he took the hand of his neighbor, who happened
to be a very pretty woman, and followed the
somewhat rapid pace of the procession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The important business of the dinner-table was
half finished: the soup, the fish, even the joints had
disappeared, and the voracity of the <span class='it'>élégants</span> had
given place to fastidiousness as they amused themselves
with a bit of <span class='it'>ris de veau glacé</span> or a <span class='it'>petit pâte
de Périgord</span>, when a slight bustle at the door
attracted universal attention. A dumpy, over-dressed
old lady, leaning on the arm of a delicate,
fair-haired girl, entered with that fussy manner so
characteristic of an out-of-place feeling, while, immediately
following her, with a complexion as cool
and fresh as marble, if one could only imagine marble
tinged with the rose-tint of youth and health—a
complexion such as nothing but a morning bath can
give—came the elegant Miss Oriel. There was the
very perfection of art in her whole appearance. She
had chosen for her entrance the moment when the
fierce appetites of those who eat to kill time (and
sometimes end by killing themselves) were sufficiently
appeased to enable them to admire something
else beside the reeking dishes. Among the heated
and flushed beauties who sat around the table, with
relaxed ringlets and moistened brows, she appeared
like some fairy of the fountain, some water nymph
fresh from her sub-marine grotto, diffusing about her
a cool and refreshing atmosphere as she moved
gracefully onward. Her dress was white transparent
muslin, which displayed rather than veiled the fine
form of her arms, while her neck and shoulders,
actually dazzling in their snowy hue and polish,
were only shadowed by a single jet-black ringlet,
which seemed to have accidentally fallen from the
clustering mass gathered at the back of her head.
A pale, pearl-like japonica was her only ornament.
As she slowly paced the length of the hall to a seat
near the head of the table, reserved for her by a
well-bribed waiter, a murmur of admiration ran
through the apartment. All eyes were fixed upon
her, and she knew better than to break the spell of
her fascinations by condescending to the vulgar taste
for eating; (a brace of woodcock had been sent to
her room only an hour previous.) Mrs. Oriel, who
seemed determined to make amends for past delay by
present haste, sent her plate to be filled and re-filled;
but her daughter only trifled with some delicate
French combination of odor and tastelessness, and
finished the meal by a morsel of <span class='it'>Charlotte au russe</span>
and Vanilla cream. A glass of iced <span class='it'>eau sacré</span> was
her only beverage, and she was thus enabled to retain
her cool fresh tint even in the heated atmosphere
so redolent of spices, and gravies, and vinous distillations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until just before quitting the table that
Miss Oriel allowed herself to see any one in the
room. She raised her large soft eyes languidly and
beheld, what she had for some time known, that her
young friend Ellen was familiarly chatting with
Cecil Forrester. A graceful bend of her fair neck
and a most lovely smile marked her consciousness
of his presence, while Cecil, with a polite but rather
careless bow continued his conversation with Miss
Grey; being incited to show her peculiar attention
by his consciousness that she, as well as himself,
was designed to be the tool of the selfish beauty.
Miss Oriel was too well schooled to exhibit any surprise
at his cool manner, and as her principal object
was to attract the attention of Mr. Beauchamp, she
gave herself no further thought about the matter at
that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Fitzroy Beauchamp, by a kind of “<span class='it'>gramerye</span>”
which some ignorant people might call <span class='it'>impudence</span>,
had early established himself at the head of the table,
and assumed the manners of a host upon all occasions.
He was in fact that most admired, and
courted, and flattered of men—the Beau (<span class='it'>par excellence</span>)
of a watering-place. Reader, if you have
ever seen such a person in such circumstances you
will be able to imagine his appearance, for he was
only one of a rather numerous tribe of ephemera,
who appear every summer and waste their little
lives in some fashionable resort, whence they vanish
with the first northeast wind, and if they do not die,
at least evaporate in something like empty air. Mr.
Fitzroy Beauchamp (he was very proud of his name,
and was known to have refused to dance in the same
cotillion with Miss Phebe Pipkin, until his refined
taste was soothed by the intelligence that she was
the heiress of half a million) was rather diminutive
in size, with a remarkably trim figure, and very
small feet. He had flaxen hair, elaborately curled,
which no one would have suspected to be a wig;
and he wore the softest and silkiest of whiskers,
which nobody dreamed were an appendage of the
self same wig, ingeniously contrived to clasp with
springs beneath his chin. His cheek had that delicate
peach bloom which rarely outlasts extreme
youth, and, in this case, certainly owed much of its
richness to a judicious touch of the hare’s foot. His
hands were very white and loaded with rings, the
gifts, as he asserted, of various fair ladies; so that
he might be said to have the history of his conquests
at his fingers’ ends. He wore a black dress coat
lined with white silk, snow-white inexpressibles,
embroidered silk stockings, and pumps diminutive
enough to have served for a lady’s slippers. Mr.
Fitzroy Beauchamp was what ladies call “a love of
a man,” and he was duly grateful for their partiality.
To conceal the ravages of time (alas! he had already
numbered half a century) and to decorate himself in
the most pleasing manner he considered a compliment
due to the fair sex, while the proper display of
his wealth and luxury was a duty he owed to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been wonderfully attracted by the grace
and beauty of Miss Oriel. Absorbed in admiration
of her easy and modest self-possession, he forgot to
ask his former favorite, the pretty and <span class='it'>spirituelle</span>
Mrs. Dale, to take wine with him, and the lady was
quick-sighted enough to discover, and wise enough
to smile at the discovery that henceforth her reign
over the tilbury was at an end. She was quite right.
Soon after dinner Mr. Beauchamp solicited from
Cecil Forrester the honor of an introduction to Miss
Oriel, and though Cecil would have been ready to
fight a duel with a fellow who should thus have presumed
after a three days’ acquaintance, had the lady
been one whom he really respected, yet he now cordially
acquiesced in the wishes of both parties, and
with a degree of magnanimity quite surprising to
Laura, afforded her exactly the opportunity she had
desired. About twenty minutes before sunset—the
hour Mr. Beauchamp usually selected for his daily
drive—Miss Oriel was handed into the elegant vehicle,
and they drove off, leaving several gentlemen
in ecstasies at her beauty as she playfully kissed her
hand to her dear old fat Mamma, who had bustled
out with “my sweet Laura’s cashmere, lest the
evening air should injure her delicate health.” Her
fears were quite unnecessary. Mr. Beauchamp
never drove his horses more than three miles at a
time, and had no fancy for hardening his white hands
by curbing their impetuosity. He was seldom absent
more than half an hour, as his ambition was fully
gratified by being envied as he drove off, or dashed
up to the door with the best horses before his carriage
and the most admired woman at his side.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE PIAZZA.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Two weeks passed away, during which time
Miss Oriel had shown her skill in female tactics by
managing to secure the attentions of Mr. Beauchamp,
while she had transferred Cecil to Ellen
Grey until she should be able to decide upon his
future fate. One evening, Cecil, who had long known
and admired Mrs. Dale, invited her to walk with him
on the piazza, that they might witness the effect of
moonlight upon the distant sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am indebted to Miss Grey’s headache for this
invitation,” said Mrs. Dale, laughing, as she took
his arm; “had she been in the saloon my eyes would
never have been thus favored with a moonlight
scene.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forrester entered a disclaimer against the lady’s
assertion, and a playful conversation ensued, when
Mrs. Dale, suddenly changing the topic, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray tell me, Mr. Forrester, if Mr. Beauchamp
is so immensely rich?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really cannot take it upon me to determine that
delicate question, Madam,” was the reply, “but, as
a firm believer in the doctrine of <span class='it'>compensations</span>, I
am bound to suppose he must be very wealthy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not understanding your premises I cannot clearly
comprehend your deductions,” said Mrs. Dale playfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Providence always bestows something to
compensate for great deficiencies, and as Mr. Beauchamp
cannot boast either mental or physical gifts,
I take it for granted that he must have money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Mr. Forrester, I did not think you were
so ill-natured. I am sure Mr. Beauchamp has the
prettiest hands and feet in the world, and his ardent
admiration of the ladies proves him to possess a
good heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To your last argument I can offer no opposition,
Madam,” was the gallant reply; “but as to his
hands and feet, I can only say that it is not the first
time that ladies have been driven to extremities in
their search for his good qualities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose,” responded Mrs. Dale, laughing
heartily, “that I must allow your wit to atone
for your severity, but how long is it since you turned
satirist?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ever since I made the discovery which all the
experience of others cannot teach us—that ‘all is
not gold which glitters.’ I have almost come to the
conclusion that nature, like an over-careful house-wife,
hides her true gold and silver in least suspected
places.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case Dame Nature might be in the predicament
of a queer old lady I once knew who hid
her rich plate under the rafters in the garret, and
when she wanted it upon occasion of a dinner-party,
was obliged to borrow of a neighbor because she
had forgotten where she had deposited her treasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe if we want to find a really virtuous and
true-hearted woman we must look elsewhere than
among the beautiful,” said Forrester bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fie! fie! if I had the slightest claim to beauty
I should banish you from my presence for that ungallant
speech.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought rather to consider it a compliment,
for there is not another woman here to whom I
would have uttered it, or who would have understood
me, perhaps, if I had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! now you flatter my intellect at the expense
of my person, and no woman ever relished such a
compliment. But to return to your assertion; how
can you venture to despise the allurements of beauty
after feasting daily on such a banquet of loveliness
as Miss Oriel offers to our eyes. I look at her,
woman as I am, with delight, for I never saw so
fresh, so pure, so marble-like a complexion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your comparison is more correct than you imagine,
Madam; her beauty is indeed like that of the
marble statue, carved by a right cunning and skilful
hand, but wanting the Promethean touch of soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While Ellen Grey is the delicate alabaster vase,
beautifully and finely wrought, and with all its exquisite
loveliness brought out in rich relief by the
lamp which lights it from within; is it not thus you
would have continued the comparison?” said Mrs.
Dale mischievously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your illustration is a beautiful one, and perfectly
true,” was the reply; “Ellen Grey is full of gentle
and womanly feeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you are prejudiced against Miss Oriel,
Mr. Forrester; can it be possible that there is no
soul shining in those soft dark eyes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is mental power enough, if that were all,
but there is no soul—no heart; the lofty impulses of
pure intellect, the tender affections of feminine nature
never yet lighted up those eyes or suffused that
marble brow with the blush of genuine feeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, as you have known the lady longer than I
have, it would be idle to dispute your assertions; indeed,
I must confess, when I watch her sweet, unruffled
look and manner, I am irresistibly reminded
of the old Norse legend of the Snow-Woman—so
dazzlingly beautiful, so fatally cold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I have seen her under circumstances which
would have given you a very different impression of
her. Imagine that beautiful woman attired in the
simplest manner, all fashionable airs laid aside, and
apparently the very creature of romantic feeling;
imagine such perfection of loveliness, with eyes of
softness and voice all tenderness, apparently yielding
up her whole soul to the sweet impressions of
nature, amid the loveliest scenery that even our
beautiful land can produce; imagine the effect of
such beauty seen beneath the soft light of the summer
moon, or gazed upon in the silent sanctuary of
the forest glades, or mingling its fascinating influence
with the lovely sights and sounds which charm the
senses in the sunset dell, when the voice of the singing
rivulet makes music on its way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon my word, Mr. Forrester, you are almost a
poet; you must be in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I am, but Miss Oriel is not the object.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you resist the fascinations you so enthusiastically
describe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, to tell the truth, I narrowly escaped the
fate of the silly moth; I came very near singeing my
wings in the blaze of her beauty, but I soon discovered
that she possessed none but personal attractions.
To be sure we had quite a sentimental flirtation,
and I remember many very fine sentiments
which she uttered, but I early found how thin and
poor was the soil in which they had taken root. You
know the most luxuriant growth of wild flowers is
always to be found in a morass—or perhaps a more
graphic illustration of my meaning might be found
in the fact that the pestilential Maremma, whose
atmosphere is so fatal to life, displays the richest and
most gorgeous array of Flora’s favorites. Laura
Oriel might be loved for a week or two, but any man
with common sense would soon see through her
false character. For my own part, I confess that I
amused myself with her very pleasantly during the
early part of the summer. Indeed, I believe she
fancied I was really caught in her snares, and no
doubt considers that ‘Cecil Forrester’s $30,000 will
do very well to fall back upon in case nothing better
offer.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark!” exclaimed Mrs. Dale, as a slight sound,
like a half-suppressed exclamation, struck upon their
ears, “I really believe some one has been listening
to our conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we first came out here,” said Forrester
coolly, “I saw a lady take her seat within the recess
of yonder window; she dropped the drapery of
the curtain behind her, so as not to be observed from
within, and she has been sitting in the deep shadow
flung by this heavy column. She has heard every
word we said; at least she has heard all I said, because
I purposely deferred my most severe remarks
until we passed within ear-shot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Heaven’s sake, what do you mean? you seem
agitated; who was the lady?” asked Mrs. Dale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not imagine? It was Miss Oriel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Forrester, how could you do so? and
to make me a party in such cruelty too;” exclaimed
the lady, much vexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that there are really no listeners, dear
Madam, I will tell you the whole story, and you
shall decide whether I am so very wrong; at all
events I have had my revenge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Cecil Forrester related to his warm-hearted
friend the story of his love and its sudden extinction,
not omitting a single word of the dialogue which he
had overheard between the mother and daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they re-entered the saloon Miss Oriel had
disappeared, but if Cecil could have known the
tumult of her feelings he would, perhaps, have regretted
his own vindictiveness. All the little feeling
which she possessed, all that she had of heart, was
bestowed on Cecil Forrester. She did not know
how much she had valued him until she compared
him with the object of her present pursuit; and,
interested, selfish and ambitious as she was, she half
determined to turn from the allurements of wealth
if she could win back Cecil to his allegiance. To
be thus outwitted, made the plaything of his idle
hours, foiled at her own weapons, was a bitter mortification,
and this, coupled as it was with a sense
of unrequited tenderness, aroused her almost to madness.
The cold, proud beauty shed tears of vexation
and regret. She almost hated Cecil, and yet she
was conscious that the most bitter drop, in the cup
which had thus been returned to her own lips, was
the assurance that he had never loved her. His
quotation of her own remark about his fortune convinced
her that he had overheard her plans, and she
was now stimulated by pride to urge their speedy
fulfilment.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE LAST SCENE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you heard the news, Mr. Forrester?” exclaimed
Mrs. Dale, as, two days after the confidential
disclosure of the piazza, he entered the
saloon; “Ah, I see by your look of innocent surprise,
you are still in blissful ignorance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has happened?” asked Cecil carelessly,
“any thing which serves to break the monotony of
a seaside existence must be a blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know whether you will think it so,”
said the lady laughing, “Miss Oriel has eloped with
Mr. Beauchamp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad of it—from my very soul I rejoice at
it,” exclaimed Cecil Forrester, while a dark, vindictive
smile gave a most disagreeable expression to
his usually fine face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, how strangely you look at me,” replied
Mrs. Dale, “what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing—nothing—when did it all happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you not see her go out with him to ride last
evening? Well, it seems Mr. Beauchamp’s servant
had been privately despatched to the city with their
baggage, and instead of returning the lovers rode
directly to the next town and were married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did they give themselves so much trouble?
If Beauchamp had asked the old woman she would
have dropped a curtsy and thanked him for the
offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the mystery of the whole affair; Mrs.
Oriel pretends to be very indignant, but it is easy to
see she is secretly pleased. Miss Oriel has written
a letter to Miss Grey in which she entreats her to
‘break the tidings tenderly to poor Mamma;’ excuses
herself on the plea of irresistible affection;
talks of Mr. Beauchamp’s ardor and her fear of maternal
opposition, and finishes by requesting Ellen to
‘allow his favorite Mrs. Dale to acquaint Mr. Forrester
with her regret at having been the cause of
disappointment and sorrow to him.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil does she mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why to make Ellen jealous of me and distrustful
of you, and thus disappoint both your love and
revenge,” said Mrs. Dale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She shall not attain her ends,” exclaimed Forrester
impetuously, “I will tell Ellen the whole
story. I am glad she is actually married to Beauchamp,
and I know the reason he did not want to
ask her mother; he was afraid of inconvenient inquiries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you know about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only this morning I met here a person who
knows him well. His history is soon told. He was
originally bred a tailor, but, having a soul above buttons,
he cut the shop, and has since been hanging on
the skirts of society in a manner very different from
that intended by his honest old father. His bank stock
and sugar plantation may exist in the regions of the
moon, where all things which unaccountably disappear
from earth are said to be collected, his
negroes are still on the coast of Guinea, and he
really lives by his wits. A run of luck at the gaming-table
or a lucky bet on the race-course enables him
every now and then to pay old debts, and live for a
time like a gentleman until his funds are exhausted,
when he again betakes himself to his vocation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can this be possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no doubt of it; he is a mere adventurer,
and as Miss Oriel is something very similar, they
are ‘matched as well as paired.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cecil Forrester afforded another proof of the truth
of the poet’s line,</p>

<p class='noindent'>The following winter saw him the happy husband
of Ellen Grey; while all trace of Mr. and Mrs.
Beauchamp was lost to their view. About two
years later, when business had compelled Mr. Forrester
to visit one of our southern cities, he strolled
into the theatre to get rid of an idle evening, and as
he gazed with listless curiosity on the gorgeous
spectacle of Indian life which occupied the stage, he
was suddenly struck with a familiar tone in the voice
and a familiar expression in the countenance of the
stately queen of the Zenana. He looked again, the
resemblance seemed to grow upon him; he went
round to the stage box, and in that near proximity
to the actress all doubt vanished. He looked upon
the still resplendent beauty of Laura Oriel.</p>

<div><h1><a id='two'></a>THE TWO DUKES.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY ANN S. STEPHENS.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;'>(Concluded from page 245.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duke saw his wife, and at first seemed willing
to avoid her, but after moving forward a step or two,
he turned back, took her hand in his with an energy
that startled her, and pressing his lips to it, turned
away and hurried on with the guard still surrounding
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess stood gazing after him, filled with
strange apprehension. The force with which he
had wrung her hand was still painful, and there was
an expression in his face which made her heart sink
with sad forebodings. What had befallen him?
Where was her daughter—and why did he, who so
seldom forgot the etiquette of his high station, take
leave of her thus, when only going forth for a morning?
As the gentle and yet proud lady stood pondering
these things in her mind, the old counsellor,
whom we have mentioned, returned slowly up the
corridor, and approaching her with touching reverence,
told her all. She thanked him, tried to smile
as she extended her hand—but in the effort her
strength gave way, and she fell pale and helpless on
the stone floor. The old man lifted her in his arms,
and carrying her to the Lady Jane Seymour’s room,
placed her on the bed, and bathed her temples with
water, which he laved from a silver basin with his
hand, till at last he went forth in despair to call
assistance, for she lay upon the glowing counterpane
pale and still, like a draped statue reposing in the
purple gloom which filled the chamber; and for
many long hours the lady who had always seemed
so quiet, proud, and almost void of feeling, remained
as one dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was half an hour before Lady Jane was informed
of her mother’s condition. She was still in her
father’s closet, with her hand locked in that of Lord
Dudley, and her large troubled eyes bent earnestly
upon him, as he spoke to her in a voice so deep, so
earnest and impassioned, that every tone thrilled
through her heart with a power that made it tremble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not look at me thus. In the name of heaven,
speak to me, Jane. I have not done this; it is no
fault of mine. Do I not love you?—ay, and will
forever! I will follow my father, beseech him,
kneel to him if needs be, and put an end to this
dreadful contest; but speak to me first—my own—my
dearest—say that you will struggle for power to
aid me that—nay, Jane, nay, do not shrink from me;
one kiss—one look, to prove you love me as before,
and I will go at once. All will terminate well—God
bless you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the young man finished his hurried speech, he
lifted the young girl from his bosom, where she had
fallen in utter abandonment to her tenderness and
grief, pressed her forehead with his lips again and
again—then folding her to his heart once more, he
carried her to the chair her father had just occupied,
and placing her within it, was about to leave the
room. Lady Jane put back the long ringlets that
had fallen over her face with both hands, and looked
after him through the tears that almost blinded her.
Then rising to her feet, she tottered toward him with
outstretched arms, and when he turned for a last
look, sprang forward and wound them almost convulsively
round his neck. It was but the paroxysm
of a moment, for scarcely did she feel his clasp
together about her, when she drew gently back,
checked the tears that gushed into her eyes afresh,
and spoke breathlessly, as one whose very heart
was ebbing with the words, as they came laden
with pain to her lips⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is in vain, Dudley, all in vain. There have been
words and deeds, this day, between your father and
mine, which must separate us forever. Farewell!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have expostulated, have soothed her
with hopes which had no foundation in his own
mind, for his thoughts were in confusion, and his
heart seemed ready to break with contending feelings;
but as he spoke, her slender fingers wreathed
themselves convulsively around his hand, her face
was uplifted to his for a moment, and she glided
swiftly through the door and along the corridor to
the chamber where her mother was lying, and left
him standing bewildered and in pain, as if a guardian
spirit had been frightened from its brooding place in
his heart.</p>

<hr class='tbk119'/>

<p class='pindent'>In an apartment belonging to that portion of the
tower occupied by the sovereigns of England sat a
pale, slender boy reading. The room was furnished
in a style of magnificence, befitting one of high rank
and of habits more elegant and studious than were
usual to the court of Henry the Eighth during his
reign. The books which it contained were richly
bound, and some of them encrusted with jewels; all
had clasps either of silver or of gold, and a portion
were entirely filled with manuscript in the hand-writing
of the late King Henry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tall windows cut deep into the massive walls in
one side of the room filled it with light. The massive
stone sills were cushioned with velvet, and
upon the cushions, musical instruments of the most
precious wood and inlaid with gold, had been flung
down, as if their owner had become weary of one
amusement only to seek another. The boy arose
from his easy leathern chair, and moving toward the
window, ran his fingers thoughtfully over the strings
of a lute that lay on the cushion, gazing idly through
the glass at a court below, as he was thus occupied.
After a moment he sauntered back to the chair, took
up the volume of manuscript which he had left open
on a small and curiously carved table standing near
the window, and sinking once more to his seat he
began to read again, but the book seemed to fatigue
him at last, so allowing it to sink, still open, to his
lap, the youth gradually sank to a fit of abstracted
musing, and sat with his head resting on his hand,
and his large eyes fixed dreamily on the face of a
great ebony clock which stood opposite the window,
its burnished face glittering through a whole bower
of carved wood, and its huge pendulum swaying to
and fro with a dull, sleepy motion, well calculated
to continue the state of languid thoughtfulness into
which the youth had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As King Edward the Sixth—for the boy was no less
a personage—sat musing, thus languid from ill health,
and rendered somewhat more sad than usual from
the manuscript and book which he had been reading,
a page entered, and before he had time to speak,
Lord Dudley, son of the reigning protector, followed
him into the room. The young nobleman looked
pale and much agitated, and Edward himself seemed
a little startled by his abrupt entrance, for he was so
little accustomed to being consulted on matters regarding
the welfare of his kingdom, that any person
thus nearly connected with the Lord Protector became
an object of nervous dread to him; for such
persons seldom interrupted his retirement except to
counsel some change of residence, or dictate regarding
his personal habits, which to a person
naturally shy, and rendered sensitive by illness, was
always a subject to be dreaded, but never opposed.
It was therefore with something of dismay in his
pale features, that Edward received his visiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley advanced close to the king’s chair, and
sinking to one knee, pressed his lips reverently to the
slender hand which the royal youth extended with
habitual courtsey, though a languid and deprecatory
smile, rather than one of welcome, stole over his lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord,” he said in a voice low and almost
femininely sweet, “I am not well to-day, but if your
good father recommends that we remove to Windsor,
let the household be prepared; he is the best
judge, though in his strong health and great energy
he does sometimes tax our weakness a thought too
far with these sudden removals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward motioned the young nobleman to arise as
he spoke, and when he still retained a kneeling
posture, looked in his face with something of astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My liege,” said Dudley in a respectful and low
voice, “I did not come from my father. Alas, since
he became Duke of Northumberland and Protector
of this realm, there has been little of confidence
between us. I have come to you, my liege, on a
subject dear as my own life, one which I dare not
again intrude upon him, though every feeling of
friendship and honor should make him listen to my
prayer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what speak you?” said Edward apprehensively,
while his large eyes wandered from the
young nobleman’s face to other objects in the room,
as if he would gladly have avoided any subject of
interest, “of whom speak you—and of what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would speak, my liege, of the duke, your highness’
uncle, of his suffering wife and daughter, who
now lie with him, prisoned within these very walls;
I would claim that justice and clemency at your
hands, which I have sought and knelt for in vain, at
the feet of my own father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king sank back into his chair, and passed his
pale hand across his forehead, as if the subject were
not only a painful one but not entirely comprehended
in its full import.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know,” he said at length, “that our uncle
has been found or thought guilty of many evil practices
against the good people of our realm, and that
our present able protector has seen it best to imprison
him for a season; but we did not know that our
noble aunt and sweet cousin Jane were the companions
of his captivity. Pray, can you inform us,
my good lord, how this all happened? Of what wrong
has our sweet playmate and cousin been accused,
that she too must be drawn from her home? His
Grace of Northumberland forgets that the same blood
which fills the veins of his king fills hers also; pray
explain, my lord. We have no power to sift all the
evil practices of our government, but even his grace,
your father, must be careful how he deals with one
of our mother’s house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feeble youth became animated with a spirit
which surprised Lord Dudley, as he uttered these
words. A bright flush spread over his cheeks, and
his eyes sparkled with the excitement which sprang
both from disease and a resentful feeling, perhaps the
most violent that ever visited his gentle heart. Naturally
kind and most affectionate in his nature, he had
always clung with fondness to those members of his
family connected with his mother, and, since her
birth, the Lady Jane had been his especial favorite.
It therefore aroused all the strong feelings of royal
pride in his heart to hear that a creature so pure and
delicate had been, through an abuse of power, made
the inmate of a prison. Nor was he better reconciled
to the fact when Dudley informed him that it was
through her own affectionate desire to mitigate the
confinement of her persecuted parent that she had
abandoned all to follow him. The youthful monarch
was touched by an act of devotion such as his own
heart would have prompted, and he questioned Lord
Dudley regarding the arbitrary power by which the
fallen protector had been imprisoned, with a degree
of energy, and an evident determination to know the
exact position of affairs, which astonished as much
as it pleased the anxious nobleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Dudley’s was a difficult and painful explanation.
It was scarcely possible to place the proceedings
against the Duke of Somerset in a favorable
light before the young king, without in some degree
exposing the conduct of his own parent to condemnation.
Still he had entered the presence of his
sovereign with a firm resolve to explain all, and
throw himself and his hopes on the generosity of a
mere boy, and an invalid, who had ever been completely
controlled by his guardians, those guardians
the very men whom he was called upon to
brave. It was with faint hopes, that Dudley undertook
this last appeal, when all other efforts to assist
his friends failed, and when he had done speaking,
when he saw the feeble youth lying back in his
chair, pale and exhausted from the emotions which
his narrative had excited, he felt almost condemned,
that any motive could have induced him to disturb
the repose of a being so fragile and sensitive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My liege, my kind, gracious master,” said the
young man, starting to his feet as the overpowered
monarch sank back to his chair, faint, pale, and with
his golden lashes quivering upon his thin cheeks as
they closed his eyes; “my gracious king, forgive me
that I have thus intruded—that for any reason I have
disturbed a repose which should be sacred to the
whole nation; but the persecution of a being so fair—so
good—one whom I have long looked upon as my
future wife—who is now suffering and in prison”⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley broke off abruptly, for all at once the hectic
color rushed back into the king’s face, and his
languid blue eyes kindled with the brilliancy of a
spirit, for the first time, thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were we indeed a king,” he said, “a true, free
king as our father was, and not the invalid child
which men see in us, these things could not happen.
No man would dare to enter the councils of a nation
and cast their leaders into prison without the sanction,
nay, command of his monarch. But, alas! there
is not in the kingdom a being more completely held
in thrall than ourself! Until now, we were scarcely
made aware of the persecution which has been so
ruthlessly urged against our uncle—but it shall not
be! The new duke, thy father, must not thus abuse
the authority with which the council, rather than
ourself, has invested him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward arose, excited to some degree of strength
by the indignation of his generous heart, and walked
up and down the room once or twice, as if to tranquilize
his spirit, then seating himself once more, he
requested Lord Dudley to explain the cause and all
the particulars of Somerset’s arrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a difficult task which the young monarch
imposed on his visiter; for Dudley loved his father,
and it was impossible to enter into the desired explanation
without, in some degree, implicating him;
but a sense of justice, and that true love which
brought him to Edward’s presence, urged him to
obedience, and while he so guarded each word as to
cast as little blame as possible on his own parent,
he pleaded the cause of his friends with a degree of
enthusiasm that aroused all the love of justice and
family affection, which were strong and predominating
qualities in the heart of the youthful monarch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward sat perfectly still, shading his eyes with
his small, thin hand, till Dudley had finished speaking;
and even for several moments after, he remained
motionless, and as if lost in thought. At last, he
allowed the hand to drop from his eyes, and looked
up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord,” he said, in a firm, clear voice, “you
have acted rightly and well in laying this subject before
us. Our reign may be a brief one, but it shall
be marked, at least, by one act of justice. Come
hither again after nightfall. Meantime we will consider
the subject and decide what can best be
done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley bent his knee reverently, kissed the pale
hand extended toward him, and left the presence.
As his fine, healthy form disappeared through the
door, and the vigorous footfall of youth and firm
health sounded back from the corridor, Edward
looked after him, smiled very sadly, and sinking
down to his chair, exhausted with the scene, murmured:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How well he is! how full of life and hope! and
I—” He covered his face with both hands, and tears
trickled through his fingers, till they fell like rain
amid the sables that lined his robe. “And yet,” he
added at last, removing his hands and wiping away
the tears, while a brighter expression stole over his
face, “and yet I have the power to make him happy—and
Jane, my sweet cousin. Let me act while I
have yet strength!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward arose once more, unlocked a miniature
cabinet which stood upon the table, and taking out a
small golden flask, drank off its contents. The potion
seemed to compose and strengthen him; a color
came to his lips, and his eyes had within them that
strange, glittering fire which springs from artificial
excitement. A small branch of twisted ebony, hung
with a cluster of tiny bells, lay upon the table. The
king took it up, and rang the bells till the apartment
seemed haunted in every nook and corner with a
gush of fairy music. As the sound died away, the
door was opened, and a page presented himself, evidently
much astonished at the energy with which his
summons had been rung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to the lieutenant of the tower,” said Edward,
promptly, as the page advanced to receive his orders.
“Tell him that the king desires his presence without
delay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy disappeared instantly; and when his companions
in the ante-room crowded near to know why
it was that a sound so full and bold had summoned
him, in place of the faint, silvery tinkle which
usually came from the king’s apartment, he put on
a look of profound mystery, and, after describing the
change which had come upon his royal master, gave
it as his decided opinion, that something very tremendous
and extraordinary was about to happen, but
what the event might be he was not at liberty to inform
them. This much he would, perhaps, venture
to say. The lieutenant of the tower would soon be
ordered to present himself before the king, and after
that something might transpire to surprise them all.
With these profound sayings, the boy departed from
the ante-room, putting on his plumed cap with an
important air, and placing a finger to his saucy red
lips, in token of secrecy, as he looked back in passing
through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an absence of half an hour, the page returned,
following the lieutenant of the tower, for
whom he ceremoniously held the door opening to
King Edward’s chamber. The lieutenant passed in
to the royal apartment, while his young escort closed
the door after him, dexterously managing to leave it
unlatched, and sufficiently ajar to command, for himself,
a view of all that was passing within, while he
stood toying with his cap, and, as his companions
supposed, retaining his station merely to be within
hearing of the king’s bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So little had Edward mingled in the affairs of his nation,
that, for the first time in his life, he addressed an
officer of his kingdom in the man who stood before
him, who stood lost in astonishment at a summons
so strange and unexpected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though a little restrained and shy in his manner,
from almost constant illness and seclusion, there was
a degree of quiet dignity about the young king’s
bearing as he extended his hand to raise the lieutenant
from his kneeling posture, that well became his
station and his royal nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have sent to command your presence, sir
lieutenant, somewhat against our usual habit; having
been informed, to-day, that our uncle, the Duke
of Somerset, with the gentle ladies of his household,
have been placed prisoners under your care. Our
desire is, that they be discharged the tower, at once,
and sent, with all due honor in our own royal barge,
to the duke’s palace on the Strand. You are commanded
to see to this; retaining only, in pledge, the
solemn word of our uncle, that he present himself
before us, his king, in three days, to be confronted
with his accusers, and to answer the charges brought
against him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward slightly waved his hand, when he finished
speaking, as if he deemed farther conversation or
ceremony unnecessary; and, after thus quietly expressing
his wishes, desired to be alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lieutenant was a shrewd man, who held his
station under favor of Northumberland, and who had
been taught, like most of his fellow subjects, to regard
the king as a mere shadow in his own realm.
He was taken by surprise—so completely deprived
of all presence of mind, by a command totally unexpected,
and most important in its nature, that for a
moment he stood gazing hard upon the floor, completely
at a loss how to act, or what to say. At last,
he cast a furtive look on the young monarch, who
stood tranquilly regarding him, but instantly turning
his eyes away, again bowed almost to the ground,
and said, in a soft, deprecating voice, that he would
mention the king’s desire to the Lord Protector forthwith,
and that he would, doubtless, sign the order
necessary for a release of the noble prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fire, like that in the eye of an angry falcon, shot
into the large, blue orbs which Edward fixed upon
his officer. A streak of crimson flashed across his
forehead; his slight figure was drawn proudly up,
and, as his velvet robe, with its heavy facings of
sables, fell back and swept the floor, there was a
majesty in his look which well became a son of
Henry the Eighth. After regarding the confused
lieutenant a second, with a glance, which made that
personage more desirous to leave the room than he
had even been to enter it, the young monarch
turned away, saying, in the same calm and tranquil
tone in which his first command had been given⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The King of England will write his own orders—wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seating himself by the table, Edward took up a
pen, and though his fingers trembled with weakness
upon the parchment, wrote and signed an order for
his uncle’s release, the first and last legal document
that his own free will ever originated. After it was
written, he took up a small agate cup, perforated in
the side, and after shaking a quantity of gold dust
over the damp ink, he folded the parchment and held
it toward the still irresolute lieutenant. There was
something in the manner with which all this was
done; so quiet, so firm and full of dignity, that, in
spite of himself, the officer was awed by a feeling
of respect which could not be resisted. Bending his
knee, he reverently took the parchment, pressed his
lips to the hand which extended it, and left the presence,
irresolute how to act, and yet deprived of
sufficient courage to resist the command of his
sovereign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the page ran forward to open a door which led
from the ante-room to a corridor, through which the
lieutenant was obliged to pass, he saw, at the farther
extremity, the Duke of Northumberland, now Lord
Protector, moving toward the king’s apartments, followed
by some half dozen retainers whom he left
near the entrance, while he advanced to meet the
lieutenant with a look of surprise and displeasure at
seeing him there. The page observed that when
the duke and his officer met, they conversed earnestly
and with considerable animation together, but in
low voices, and all the time looking suspiciously
around to be certain that no person was within hearing.
They were thus engaged for more than ten
minutes, while the restless page stood, with the door
in his hand, regarding them through a crevice thus
conveniently created to gratify his curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said he, muttering to himself as he softly
swung back the door a little to increase his opportunity
of survey—“now, if I could but steal through
without making these rusty hinges sound an alarm,
it would be rare pastime to creep along the wall and
hear what treason those lofty old fellows are plotting.
It is no light matter, I’ll warrant—see, how
the tall old duke clutches his fingers and bends his
dark forehead over his eyes till one can scarcely see
them, beneath the hoary brows—see, his lips are
pressing hard upon each other like a vice—now is
his turn to speak—nay, if I were master lieutenant
now, beshrew me! but I should get away from that
beautiful old gentleman without waiting to say ‘by
your leave!’ There he stands, looking the king a
thousand times more than my young master yonder,
and I doubt not berating that poor lieutenant, as if he
were a hound. See, how slowly, and with what a
manner he lifts that right hand, holding the finger up,
and shaking it before the poor lieutenant as if it were
the blade of a dagger. Beshrew me! but I must
learn more of this game—the corridor is half in
shadow, and they can but kick me out, like a troublesome
dog, if I am discovered—so be quiet, latch and
hinge, if you can, for once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the boy half muttered, half thought these words,
he gently pushed back the door, and was about forcing
himself through the opening, but a noise, created by
the rusty hinges, was not the only means of betraying
his attempt. A space large enough to admit his
body also served to fling a line of light far into the
dim corridor, which startled the two persons he was
regarding more than a noise could have done. They
both turned and looked keenly toward the door. The
duke uttered a brief sentence and moved on, waving
his hand imperatively to the lieutenant. He also
went down the passage, and passing the group of
attendants in a hurried manner, disappeared through
a door at the opposite extremity, through which the
duke had entered the corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the page, finding himself in danger of
detection, had escaped to his post near the king’s
chamber. When Northumberland approached, he
arose from the bench on which he had flung himself,
looked up from beneath the feathers of his cap, with
a sleepy yawn, and moved forward to announce the
Lord Protector, rubbing his eyes as he went, and
laughing with silent mischief beneath the concealment
of his drooping plumes. As the duke passed
him at the door, he paused an instant and fixed a
keen glance on his face, which the boy returned by
taking off his cap, and bending his curly head almost
to the ground, while, with the most frank and cheerful
of all voices, he prayed for long life to the noble
Lord Protector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Northumberland had any suspicion of the boy
at first, it was half disarmed by that clear voice and
the handsome face sparkling with intelligence lifted
to his. There was something mischievous and yet
affectionate and pleasing in it, which brought a smile
to his own face as, with careless munificence, he flung
a piece of gold into the boy’s cap and entered the
king’s chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page was not so much elated by the gift but
that he would have been at his old trick of listening
once more; but after advancing a pace into the chamber,
Northumberland turned back, looked at the
urchin with a half smile, and closed the door himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A laugh from his companions, who witnessed his
defeat from another end of the room, sent a flood of
crimson over the boy’s face, but shaking his curls
with an air of good-natured bravado, he gave the
golden coin a triumphant toss, which sent it flashing
like a star up into the sunshine which poured through
a neighboring window, and catching it in his hand
again, sprang forward and joined the laugh merrily
as the most gleeful among them. Instantly, the noisy
troop were silenced by a sharp bell-tone from the
king’s chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” said the page, balancing the coin on his
finger and eyeing it with a roguish look as he bent
his head to listen. “That was the crusty old duke!
such fellows hate an honest laugh as King Harry did
holy water! they would keep us cooped up here like
a flock of pigeons without the privilege of a coo.
Hark! again, I must keep quiet till the old one is
away, and then we will try a game of chuck farthing
in the corridor, if we can get this shiner changed
into half crowns and farthings.” So, grasping his
fingers over the gold, the page nodded to his companions,
leaving them half terrified by the thoughts
that their merriment had reached—not the king, he
was too good and lenient to chide them for harmless
mirth—but the stern duke, whom they all feared beyond
measure. The page looked back upon them,
as he entered the chamber, tried to smile and seem
courageous, though he was half frightened out of his
wits—and the next instant stood in the presence of
his sovereign, with his bright, black eyes—half concealed
by their long lashes—bent to the floor, and a
brilliant red burning through the ringlets that fell
over his cheek. He seemed the very picture of a
living and healthy Cupid in disgrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What noise was it that reached us but now from
the ante-room?” said the Lord Protector, sternly, as
the boy appeared before him. “Is it with this rudeness
and riot you surround the chamber of our invalid
king? Begone, sirrah! strip off the royal livery at
once and return to your mother, if you have one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy lifted his face to that of the stern duke
and his cheek dimpled even while it turned white
with fear, a smile was so natural to it. But when
the last cruel words were spoken, the long lashes
drooped over his eyes again and grew heavy with
moisture. He turned away from the face frowning
upon him, and, kneeling at the king’s feet, lifted his
eyes—now full of tears—to those of his master and
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward’s kind heart was deeply touched by the
sadness with which this was said. He was but a
youth himself, and forgetful of his dignity and of all
but the sweet, pleading face lifted to his, he laid
his thin hand upon the curls which fell back from it,
and would have kissed the forehead, but an exclamation
from Northumberland warned him of the impropriety.
Still the page had seen the impulse and
the generous tears which filled the mild eyes of his
master. His young heart swelled with grateful
affection, and, burying his head in Edward’s robe, he
sobbed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor boy! he is an orphan like ourself. You
will not send him hence, my lord duke,” said the
young king, turning his face with an anxious and
almost pleading look upon his guardian. “The
offence was not heavy; and see how penitent he is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The offence not heavy, my liege?” replied the
duke harshly, “have I not given orders that no
sound shall disturb your highness’ repose, and notwithstanding
this, am I not distracted almost in my
first private audience by the riotous mirth of this
urchin and his mates?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, we have ourself somewhat to blame in this—having
little cause for merriment in our own heart,
and pining here day after day—for, alas! kings have
no companions—it has sometimes been a comfort to
hear the merry laugh of these thoughtless boys—to
know that cheerfulness is not shut out from our presence
forever. That health and laughter—which is
its music—is yet a thing of earth; though, alas! a
blessing which we may witness, but never enjoy.
Shut out the sunshine which smiles through these
windows, the stars which at night time glimmer
through that narrow line of glass, and which we
have learned to read when pain has made our couch
sleepless, till they have become as old friends; break
yon lute, whose music is to this faint heart like the
voice of a good child to its parent, and, above all,
send away the cheerful voices which sometimes fill
the next room, and you have wrested from the King
of England the only fragment of his inheritance that
was ever his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page looked up as his master was speaking,
the tears were checked in his eyes, and he knelt
breathlessly, as one who listened to the voice of an
angel. The proud Northumberland turned his eyes
from the pale, spiritual face of his royal ward, and
bent them on the floor. There was a look of patient
suffering in those features which touched his better
nature; something in the sad, broken-hearted feelings
which filled that voice, which found a passage
to his soul, even through the selfishness and ambition
that encased it. Other thoughts, too, were busy
in his mind. He had a point to carry with the young
monarch—a difficult and doubtful one. His animosity
against the page only arose from resentment, excited
by his conversation with the lieutenant, and some
faint suspicion that he had played the listener while
that conversation was held. A moment’s reflection
convinced him that to have heard any part of his
conference, from the distance at which he had caught
a glimpse of the boy in the corridor, was impossible;
so, resolving to make his concession the means of
obtaining a much greater one from the king, Northumberland
determined to seem won to mercy by
sympathy and regard for his ward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While these thoughts were passing through the
mind of that crafty man, Edward remained in his
chair, supporting his head with one hand, while the
other still lay caressingly, and half buried amid the
bright ringlets of the kneeling culprit, who gathered
the royal robe between his small hands, and kissed
the glowing velvet with grateful eagerness, while
his bright face was again deluged with tears—such
tears as can only know their birth in a warm, wayward,
and affectionate nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive the pain my zeal in behalf of a health so
precarious has occasioned,” said the duke, advancing
graciously to the king, while his face relapsed
into one of those bland smiles which sometimes
beamed like magic over his proud features. “Heaven
forbid that anything which is dear to your highness,
however faulty, should be condemned by one
whose first aim is to render his king happy! Let
the boy go at once! Far be it from me to desire
his chastisement. Go, sirrah,” he added, taking
hold of the boy’s arm and lifting him from his knees,
but still giving to the action and words a tone of good-natured
encouragement, “go to the ante-room; here
is another piece of gold to repay the fright we have
given you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page stood up; his checks flushed once more
beneath the tears that stained them. He looked upon
the proffered gold, and, with a motion of the head,
betraying both pride and boyish petulance, seemed
about to refuse it, but a glance from his master, and
something in the duke’s eye which awed him,
checked the resentful impulse, and taking the gold,
with half muttered thanks, he knelt once more at
Edward’s feet, kissed the hand which was kindly
extended, and bursting into tears again, left the
chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment he reached the ante-room, our page
flung himself on a bench, and burying his face in the
tapestry that cushioned it, sobbed aloud. His companions
gathered about him in dismay, anxious to
learn the cause of his tears; but it was a long time
before he would reply to their questions. At last he
started up, dashed the two pieces of gold on the
stone floor till they rang again, and told his friends
to take them up—fling them into the court below—toss
them for farthings—do anything with them—but
protested that he would never touch them again.
After this ebullition of boyish wrath, he gave a glowing
description of the tyranny which had been practised
upon him by the duke; of the goodness of his
royal master; and of the great danger which had
threatened them all. Whereupon, they jointly and
severally entered into a contract never to laugh again
during the whole course of their lives—a resolution
they persisted in keeping for a full half hour, when
our young hero set them all into convulsions by a
most ludicrous imitation of the protector’s manner as
he took leave of the lieutenant. When this new
burst of merriment died away, the group of youngsters
stood for a while frightened by their own boldness,
and expecting each moment to hear another
summons to the royal chamber; but instead of the
sound they feared, came another which overwhelmed
them with surprise. It was the voice of their royal
master, louder than any one had ever heard it before,
and powerful with strong feeling. The duke’s voice
was also heard, sometimes stern and almost disrespectfully
harsh, again soothing and persuasive, with
something of that cajolery in its tone which one
might expect from the hired nurse of a wayward
child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While these unusual sounds were continued in the
king’s apartment, the pages gradually drew nearer
to the door, till they could command some broken
sentences of what was passing within. At length
the king’s voice grew fainter and less distinct.
Northumberland now and then uttered a brief sentence,
and his heavy footsteps were plainly heard
as he strode up and down the room. At last a sharp
ringing of the bells sent the listeners to a distant
part of the room, where they stood gazing in each
other’s faces, uncertain whether they ought to obey
the summons or not. Their doubts were speedily
relieved, for the door was flung open and the Duke
of Northumberland appeared, looking pale and much
agitated. He beckoned with his hand, and the page
that we have mentioned so often entered the chamber.
He found the king lying back in his chair, faint
and pale as death; his lips were perfectly bloodless,
and though he seemed insensible, the silken vest
worn beneath his robe was agitated by the quick and
terrible beating of the heart it covered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With instinctive affection, the page untied the
silken fastenings of his master’s dress, and exposing
the delicate neck and chest, which heaved and throbbed
as if the heart were forcing a passage through,
he commenced chafing it with his hands, till the agitation
became less painful and apparent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, Edward unclosed his eyes and drawing
his doublet together with a trembling hand, tried to
sit up. Northumberland advanced and seemed about
to address him, but he shrank back with a nervous
shudder. After a moment, he got up again and
would have spoken, but his lips only trembled; he
had no strength to utter a word. Northumberland
walked to a window, where he stood some time with
his arms folded, gazing gloomily through the thick
glass. Still the page knelt by his master, chafing his
hands, and folding the robe over his feet with that
kind assiduity which bespoke an affectionate nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length Edward spoke, and the duke turned
eagerly from the window, evidently relieved by this
proof that his late attack would not be immediately
fatal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord,” said the king, faintly, “you see how
impossible it is that this subject can be discussed
farther. I beseech your grace, have my wishes
obeyed, both regarding your son and all the parties
concerned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Northumberland’s brow darkened, and he
seemed about to expostulate, but Edward looked him
gravely in the face and added,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>must</span> be so, my lord duke, or England will not
brook the imprisonment of a protector who, with all
his faults, knew how to respect the rights of his
king.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The color forsook Northumberland’s face, but
still he frowned and looked unyielding. Edward
arose feebly from his chair, and leaning upon the
shoulder of his page, moved toward an inner bed-chamber.
The duke saw by this movement that all
hope of further conference was cut off, and feeling
himself baffled and forced to act against his wishes
by a mere youth, he once more forgot his usual
crafty composure and the respect due to his
sovereign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My liege,” he said, almost imperatively, “this is
requiring too much; I cannot grant it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward turned so as to face the angry noble, and
while still supported by the page, answered mildly,
but with the same steady will as before,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Lord of Northumberland,” he said, “either
our uncle, the Duke of Somerset, returns to his
palace to-morrow as we have directed, or on the
next day he goes there Lord Protector of England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a slight wave of the hand, and with his
features contracted with the pain which his effort
to speak occasioned, Edward turned away and
passed into his bedchamber without waiting for a
reply, which, in truth, Northumberland was unable
to give, so completely was he astounded by what
had already been said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page would have called other assistance when
Edward reached his bedchamber, but the invalid prevented
him, and after having the points of his dress
untied, lay down upon the bed, faint and exhausted.
The boy moved about him with that soft, gentle tread
so grateful in the chamber of an invalid. He
smoothed the pillows, drew the counterpane of embossed
velvet over the recumbent monarch, and,
taking some scented woods from a closet, flung them
into a brasier that stood in the fire-place, and nursed
the flame beneath till the chamber was filled with a
soft, drowsy atmosphere, grateful to the sense, and
almost certain to produce tranquil sleep. Then he
would steal once more to the bed, pull back the
voluminous curtains, and bend over the pale form
resting there till his dimpled cheek, so damask and
healthy, almost touched that of the monarch, and the
wreath of his bright curls fell amid the damp masses
of hair which swept over the pillow, in a contrast
that was lovely and yet painful to behold. When
satisfied that his master was asleep, the boy stole
softly from the chamber, as had always been his
habit, to await the time of his waking in the next
room. He started with surprise on seeing it still
occupied by the Duke of Northumberland, who stood
before the window gazing sternly into the court below,
and evidently lost in a train of most unpleasant
thoughts. When the boy entered he started impatiently,
and, clearing the frown from his face with an
effort, crossed the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell your master,” he said, addressing the page,
“tell your master that his wishes shall be obeyed—say
that all shall be in readiness by eight this evening;”
and with these words Northumberland left
the royal apartments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Either the protector’s voice aroused Edward, or
he had not slept, for scarcely was the door closed
when his voice summoned the page to his bedside.
When the duke’s message was repeated to him, a
smile of satisfaction settled on his face, and he sank
into a tranquil slumber. After awhile those usually
quiet apartments were full of bustle and preparation.
Attendants passed in and out; pages were seen running
to and fro with mysterious faces. More than
one laden wherry untied its contents at the tower
stairs, and everything bespoke the approach of some
uncommon event.</p>

<hr class='tbk120'/>

<p class='pindent'>One little month had scarcely passed when the
Duke of Somerset, bereft of wealth and station, sat
in a gloomy prison room of the tower, expecting
each moment to be dragged forth to trial, and, perhaps,
an ignominious death. It was a large room,
but so dimly lighted that persons sitting together
looked sallow and careworn in the dusky atmosphere
that filled it. The very sunbeams forced themselves
sluggishly through the high window, as if rusted by
the masses of old iron which blocked their passage,
and were lost, long before they reached the floor, in
a web of ragged and dusty cobwebs, which covered
the ceiling like mouldering tapestry, moth-eaten and
turning to dust where it hung. There, on the gloomy
floor of this desolate place, sat the prisoner, striving
to read by the unhealthy light, which was only sufficient
to make the effort a painful one. He lifted his
eyes to the grating with an impatient exclamation,
and, flinging his book on the floor, began pacing up
and down the stone flags. Instantly a figure started
forward from an inner room and lifted the book;
while the sweet, pale face of Lady Jane Seymour
was raised for a moment to that of her suffering parent,
as he moved rapidly up and down the room.
She laid the book once more upon the flags, and
exerted all her frail strength to move the chair her
father had occupied to a station nearer the window.
This done, she again lifted the ponderous volume
with her two fair hands, smoothed out the dark letter
page which had been doubled in the fall, and bearing
it to the duke, besought him to sit down, while she
read aloud to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somerset paused a moment in his walk, impelled
by the persuasive but sad tones of his child; but
confinement had made him irritable; so, extricating
his disordered cloak from the slight grasp which she
had fixed upon it, he pushed the book from him with
a violence which sent it crashing to the floor again,
and resumed his restless occupation. The book had
fallen upon the flags, with its broad leaves downward,
and crushed beneath the heavy binding, that,
with the ringing of the heavy clasps, as they struck
the stones, brought another person into the room,
but so changed, so thin, and broken-hearted in appearance,
that few persons who had seen the dignified,
proud, and lovely Duchess of Somerset, in her
high estate, could have recognised her as she stood
within the sickly atmosphere of her husband’s dungeon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentle lady moved across the room, her rich,
but now soiled, vestments sweeping the dusty floor
as she passed; while her daughter was patiently
occupied in smoothing the pages which had been
injured in their fall, and in brushing away the dust
which they had gathered, she approached her husband,
placed a hand upon his arm, and looked with
a sad smile into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The apartment within is less gloomy than this,”
she said; “come and sit with us; you, who never
failed to share the sunshine of life with us, should
not thus brood alone, now that sorrow has befallen
us. Come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somerset turned abruptly from his noble wife, and
to conceal the emotions her sweet, patient manner
had awakened, rather than from continued moodiness
of spirit, he still paced up and down the darkest
part of his dungeon, with all the appearance of continued
irritation, for he was ashamed of the tears
which, in spite of himself, sprang to his eyes on
witnessing his gentle and yet proud wife so fallen
and so patient in her ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess was rendered quick-sighted by affection,
and, speaking in a low voice to her daughter,
the two left the fallen man to the liberty of grief.
The room which they entered was scarcely superior
to the other, but more light was admitted to it; and
where is the spot so dark, or so full of discomfort,
that a loving and intelligent woman cannot give
some domestic charm to it? When the unfortunate
lady and her still more unfortunate child left their
palace home, and besought permission to share the
confinement of a husband and a father, they had
been permitted to bring a few objects of comfort to
cheer the desolation which surrounded him. Several
leathern chairs, and a stool or two, cushioned and
embroidered by the fair beings who selected them
for that reason, stood within the room. Lady Jane
had swept and garnished the stone floor with her
own delicate hands, all unused as they had been to
such menial service. A rude table was there, a few
favorite books lay upon it, and a lute, the companion
of many a happy, childhood hour, was now taken
up by that gentle girl, that its sweet tones might
soothe the moody spirit of the proud man, who
seemed scarcely conscious of her effort to tranquilize
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Jane knew that it but mocks a broken spirit
to see anything it loves over-cheerful; so her strain,
though not gloomy, was touching, and a sad one, so
sad that her father, as he walked in the adjoining
room, forgot the selfishness of his sorrow and wept
like a child, that two creatures so gently nurtured
should thus inhabit a prison, and, for his sake, exert
their broken spirits to render it cheerful. After a
while he entered the apartment where they were,
and going up to the duchess he bent down and kissed
her, while his right hand rested on the head of the
young girl sitting at her feet. Lady Jane lifted her
grateful eyes to his face and smiled. When her
father kissed her forehead also fondly, and with the
affection of former times, a swarm of kindly feelings
sprang to her heart; her light fingers touched the
lute again, and a gush of music, not gay, and yet
scarcely sad, filled the dungeon room. It was a
home song, such as they had loved in better days,
and it awoke many pleasant memories; so, amid all
their sorrows, these three persecuted beings sat together
in domestic companionship, almost happy. If
chains were upon them, their love of each other
twisted a few golden links amid the iron which no
human power could wrest away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memories which the song awakened gradually
led the conversation to brighter themes, and for
awhile the inmates of that dungeon almost forgot
their present condition. They talked of former days,
and, as they talked, an expression amounting almost
to a smile rose to the face of the father. The sunshine,
too, seemed to partake of their joy, streaming
in more gaily through the narrow window, and playing,
like a wilful but merry child fitfully across the
floor; while a bird—a wanderer from green fields
far away—pausing a moment outside the casement,
poured forth such a gush of music that it thrilled the
inmost hearts of the listeners with joy. Could the
duke have seen them then how would he have
envied them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as the day wore on, their thoughts once more
were brought back to the full consciousness of their
present situation, and again a shadow came over the
souls of the members of that little family, typical
of the sunshine which but just before had been
shining so merrily through the casement, but which
now had vanished, leaving the dungeon room dark
and forbidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gloom of coming night at last gathered thickly
in the dungeon, rendering it still more cold, desolate
and prison-like. The duke still retained his sombre
mood and gazed gloomily on the stone flags at his
feet, while his patient wife sat by his side, her hand
resting in his, and her sweet, low voice now and
then whispering words of endearment, such as her
proud and modest nature had considered too bold at
any time save when the beloved one was in affliction,
or in any place except that miserable dungeon
room. Hers was the love of a true and delicate
nature. And, like the flame of a lamp which, scarcely
seen amid the glare of sunshine, grows brighter and
more vivid when surrounded by darkness, it seemed
the only faithful or bright possession left to the fallen
man. Nay, there was yet another, scarcely less
wretched than himself, or less clinging and affectionate
than the woman who would have comforted
him. That gentle girl, still tireless in her wish to
please, crouched at his feet, and the soft notes of her
lute stole up tremblingly and thrilled amid the darkness
which shrouded them all. She felt that her
father’s thoughts were far from her, that the melody
which sprang from her weary fingers was all unheeded,
and yet she played on, glad that in the darkness
she could weep without being seen. So, as her
hand wandered over the strings, tears streamed
down her pale cheeks, unchecked, and fell upon it
till the fingers were damp as if they had been laved
in a fountain. Sometimes a sob would escape with
the tears, but then came a gush of wilder music and
the voice of her sorrow was concealed by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wife still wound her fingers lovingly in the
prisoner’s hand, grieved that no answering clasp was
given back, and yet chiding herself for selfishness
that she could expect to be thought of at such a time.
The daughter wept on, and still coined her tears into
music. But the husband and father had become
almost unconscious of these efforts; he was like a
caged lion indignant with his keepers, and with his
heart full of the forest where he had once prowled a
king. At last there was a sound of feet mustering
at the prison door. It was about the hour when their
evening meal might be expected. The little group
looked listlessly up when the bolts were withdrawn,
and the glare of a torch fell bright and crimson
through the door. Somerset started to his feet,
while the duchess withdrew her hand, and resuming
her usual air of gentle dignity moved back a pace,
where she stood pale and composed, ready to receive
the lieutenant who, for the first time, entered their
dungeon in person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My lord duke,” said the lieutenant, addressing
his prisoner with some embarrassment, but throwing
into his voice and manner that respectful homage
which the fallen protector had scarcely hoped to
witness again; “my lord duke, I am sorry to intrude
on your privacy, or to interrupt the music with
which this gentle lady soothes your prison hours, but
I have orders for your removal to another room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To another room!” exclaimed the duchess,
while her cheek blanched whiter and her voice was
changed with apprehension, “and we, his daughter
Lady Jane and myself, surely, surely, we go also!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet, noble lady; the protector has ordered
it otherwise; but I beseech you take it not to heart,
the separation will be a brief one,” said the lieutenant,
bending before the terrified duchess as he spoke.
“Nay, sweet lady, do not weep,” he continued,
turning to Lady Jane, who had dropped her lute to
the floor, and stood directly in the light, with her
hands clasped firmly together and her tearful face
exposed; “it pains me to witness such sorrow for a
cause so groundless. It is but a change of apartments!
A short time and you will doubtless receive
the Lord Protector’s sanction to cheer the noble
duke’s apartments once more; meantime, my orders
are imperative! My lord duke, I trust that you will
not be displeased with the change. Permit me to
lead the way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be ready to attend you in a moment,” replied
the duke, “but first grant me a moment’s privacy.
As my return is uncertain, I would take leave
of the duchess and my child without so many witnesses!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lieutenant bowed, and withdrawing from the
dungeon, closed the door. Then all the strong affections
of his nature rushed back upon the wretched
duke, for he believed that they were separating him
from his family forever. He tried to speak, but could
not; a rush of feelings, that had weighed down his
heart to apathy before, choked his utterance; a silent
embrace and the clinging arms of his wife were
forced from his neck; another embrace, a blessing
on his child, and before they could cry out or strive
to detain him, the door swung to with a sharp crash,
the light disappeared, and those suffering and helpless
creatures were left alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother!” That word arose amid the darkness
faint and broken with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child, we are alone!” replied a second
voice, made strong by the agony of parting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not alone, mother, God is with us!” And,
as she spoke, that noble girl stretched forth her
hands and groped the way to her mother in the darkness.
As she passed the lute, which still remained
on the floor, her garments brushed the strings and a
tone of music stole through the room—a pleasant
tone—and it seemed that an angel had answered to
those trustful words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess, who had sunk down in agony of
heart, began to weep when she heard the sound, and
so, in that dark and lonesome prison room, those two
helpless beings clung together and comforted each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour went by, and once more a sound of heavy
feet was heard outside their dungeon. The bolts shot
back and a flood of light revealed the duchess sitting
in the chair left vacant by her husband. Kneeling
upon the floor, and half lying in her mother’s lap,
was the Lady Jane; her face had been buried in the
vestments of her parent, and she had been praying,
but, as the door opened, her head was thrown back
and a joyful expression filled the soft brown eyes
turned eagerly upon the entrance. It was crowded
with people, and an exclamation of pleasant surprise
burst from the duchess and her daughter when two
females entered the dungeon, each with a heavy bundle
under her arm. In the foremost Lady Jane recognised
her old nurse, and the other had long been
chief tyring-woman to the duchess. Never were
human beings so welcome, never two beings “so
happy without knowing why,” as these old warm-hearted
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said the nurse, holding the Lady Jane
in her arms, and kissing her fondly between the
words; “there, I say, you with the crusty face, roll
in the coffer—that will do!” she added, as one of the
men brought in a good sized coffer, which the
duchess recognised as her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” continued the old woman, still with her
arms around her astonished foster-child, “place that
mirror on the table; softly, man, softly, you are not
wielding your iron bolts now, and that silver frame
is easily bruised if you knock the fillagree work
about after that fashion!—there, set it down, for a
bungler as you are; place the lamp in front; be
careful, knave, you are treading on my lady’s lute—pick
it up!” The man pushed the lute aside with his
foot, and set the lamp down without regard to the
old woman’s order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, you cannot pick up the lute which a noble
lady has fingered, forsooth! Wait a few days, and
we shall see you creeping on your knees for the
honor, instead of standing there with a look as stubborn
as your own iron bars. Go, bring in the case
of essence bottles, if that does not prove too heavy a
task, and then take yourself off, for a clumsy cur; a
pretty serving-man you would make, I trow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man, on whom the old woman’s eloquence
was exercised, seemed very willing to obey her last
command. He brought in the case which she had
desired, and, placing it on the table, left the dungeon
and was about to lock the door, but just as he was
closing it a clear cheerful voice was heard in conversation
with him. After a moment’s delay, the
half-closed door was swung open again to admit a
handsome boy in the king’s livery, who carried a
casket under his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was well thought of, my pretty page,” said
the nurse, approaching to take the casket, “but who
has found courage to break the new protector’s seal?
If it was you, boy, I only hope that handsome head
may be firm on your shoulders six weeks hence.
I would as soon have touched a red-hot coal as the
bit of wax sticking to the smallest cabinet in the
palace, and I saw all my lady’s jewels counted and
locked up weeks ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she spoke, the old nurse allowed the Lady
Jane to escape from her embrace, while she advanced
to the page, and would have taken the casket
from under his arm, but he stepped aside, with a
roguish toss of the head, and dropping on his knee
before the young lady, placed the casket in her hand.
Bewildered, and as one in a dream, she gazed first
upon the casket, then, wonderingly, on the handsome
boy at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means this?” she said at last, looking
doubtfully toward the duchess, who sat gazing upon
the scene with equal wonder. “Our crest is upon
the lid, but underneath are the royal arms of England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess arose, and, taking the casket from her
daughter’s hand, touched a spring. The lid flew
open, and, with an exclamation of surprise, the ladies
saw, not their own jewels, but a magnificent suite
of diamonds which had once belonged to Jane Seymour,
the Queen of Henry the Eighth; a young creature
who had perished in giving birth to the present
king—fortunate, perhaps, in being taken from her
earthly state before she had learned how terrible a
thing it was to “outlive her husband’s liking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What means this—whence came the jewels?”
exclaimed both ladies at once, turning their eyes
from the gems that flashed and glowed in the lamplight,
to the boy who had risen from his knees, and,
with his plumed cap, was brushing away the dust
which his vestments had caught from the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They were entrusted to me by my royal master,
the king,” replied the boy, who paused in his occupation
and gazed upon the casket, as he spoke, fascinated
by the rich hues that played and quivered
about it. “I was bade to deliver them to the Lady
Jane Seymour—to say that the king desired that she
would mingle them with the adornments of her fair
person before she placed herself under the escort of
the lieutenant, who will be here anon to bring farther
orders from the Lord Protector.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the astonished ladies could question him
farther, he had obeyed some signal given him from
the door, and left the dungeon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in vain the noble duchess questioned the
nurse and the tyring-woman. They were too much
elated to gratify the anxiety of their mistress, even if
they had not been as much mystified as herself. All
they could say was, that a messenger had been sent
from the Duke of Northumberland with orders to
convey them to the tower; that they were commanded
to take from the wardrobe, in the palace,
every thing necessary for the toilet of their ladies.
Though scarcely half an hour was allowed them for
a choice, they had filled a coffer, and, with a few
things hastily collected, were hurried into a barge
and so to the dungeon of their mistress, scarcely
realizing how it had all been brought about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This unsatisfactory information only served to
increase the excitement already produced in the
minds of the prisoners; while their attendants were
busily searching for keys, and smoothing the rich
vestments that had been somewhat roughly crowded
into the coffer, they looked on as people in a dream.
The glare of lights which filled every gloomy angle
of their dungeon; the velvet robes flung in glossy
robes over the armed chair; the jewels, twinkling and
flashing like a cluster of stars, on the table—all
seemed like enchantment, and they looked on with
a strange emotion of hope mingled with foreboding
and almost with affright. Still there was something
in all that had transpired, calculated to encourage
more than to depress. So after a few brief words
of consultation, the mother and daughter sat down
and permitted the two women to adorn their persons
without farther question. The duchess was speedily
arrayed. In spite of her fears, a ray of hope had been
awakened, and her face, before so pale and care-worn,
became almost happy in its expression, save that a
color, far more vivid than was natural to her cheek,
betrayed the anxious fears that struggled against the
more hopeful feeling that had sprung to life in her
heart. She stood by as they wreathed the diamond
tiara amid the tresses of her daughter’s hair, and,
with her own fair hand, put back two or three of the
brown curls where they fell over the young cheek,
which gradually became warm and damask from the
influence of anticipations which she could not entirely
control, and yet which she trembled to encourage.
How beautiful she looked in her robe of
glowing velvet, with the tiara which had once
adorned a queen, shedding its starry brightness amid
her hair and over that pure forehead. Her neck,
always beautiful, now gleamed out with more pearly
whiteness beneath the string of brilliants that shed a
rich light upon it; and, as the old nurse busied herself
with the point lace which draped her rounded
arms, she looked up to her mother, and a sweet, natural
smile came faintly over her face. The mother
did not smile, but a brighter expression lighted up
her eyes, and the two looked almost happy making
their strange toilet in a dungeon. The nurse had
taken that little hand, which trembled in her clasp
with conflicting emotions, and after pressing her lips
upon the rosy palm, was drawing on the snowy
glove with its embroidery of seed pearls, when there
was a sound at the door, as of some person knocking
against it with his knuckles, and, after a moment, the
lieutenant of the tower once more presented himself.
When the duchess advanced eagerly toward him,
demanding a reason for all that had transpired, he
answered with the calm politeness which usually
marked his demeanor, that the Lord Protector
had given orders that they should be removed to another
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, tell me,” said the lady, almost beside herself
with anxiety, “tell me, is it to the duke—is it
to my husband you conduct us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A smile stole up to the lieutenant’s face. It might
be one of irony aroused by the keen anxiety which
she displayed: it might be a sign of admiration for
the two beings that could look so lovely amid the
gloom of a dungeon; but they could not read its
meaning, and he would give no other reply to their
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady Jane began to tremble, but she placed her
arm within that of the duchess, and was supported
from the dungeon. Her heart died within her bosom
as she found herself in a long, damp passage, surrounded
by strange faces, and going, she could
scarcely dream where. She looked in her mother’s
face; it had become very pale again, and the arm on
which she leaned shook beneath the weight of hers.
All at once, she felt that the train of her dress had
been lifted from the floor. She looked round, and
there was that handsome little page grasping the
folds of velvet in his small hand, while his bright
face was lifted smilingly to hers. He seemed to
comprehend and pity the anxiety betrayed by the
troubled expression of her face, for drawing close to
her side, he whispered⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have no fear, sweet lady, there is nothing of
harm to dread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sirrah, fall back to your place,” said the lieutenant,
looking sternly over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy shrank back, but not till his words had
brought comfort to the heart of Lady Jane, and were
whispered in the ear of her mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On they went, through dark passages and gloomy
chambers;—the flambeau carried by their guard,
crimsoning the walls as they passed on, and their
shadows changing, and seeming to dance in fantastic
groups around them as the lights were tossed upwards
and flared in the chill currents of air that
drew down the corridors. At last, they entered a
large room, lighted up and surrounded by a range of
cushioned benches, from which some half dozen
pages arose with great show of respect as the party
entered. The lieutenant and his officers remained
standing at the entrance to the room, while two of
the pages ran forward to an opposite door, which
they held open as if the ladies were expected to pass
through. The duchess turned her eyes on the lieutenant,
uncertain how to act; he bent his head, and
drawing respectfully back, answered her appeal in
a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady,” he said, “my charge ends here; pass on
to the next room, where the king awaits you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duchess started as she heard this, and grasping
the hand which rested on her arm, whispered⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, my child, all will be well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though taken by surprise, the noble lady had been
so long accustomed to courts that, in crossing the
ante-chamber, she resumed the quiet and dignified
manner which anxiety had previously disturbed, but
the quick feelings of youth could not be so readily
controlled, and when the duchess presented herself
in King Edward’s apartments, the young creature
leaning on her arm was pale as death beneath all
the warm glow of her jewels, and trembled visibly
with suppressed agitation. The duchess cast a quick
glance over the room. Her husband was there, not
in his prison garments but robed as became his
station, and by his side stood the Duke of Northumberland—though
her heart leaped at the sight, she
remained to all appearance composed and ready to
sustain the dignity of her noble house before the
man who had been its bitter enemy. Lady Jane
also looked up, and recognised her father, with a
thrill of joy such as she had seldom known before,
but instantly the happy glow died from her face, and
almost gasping for breath she clung to the duchess
for support. She had seen another face, that made
her heart tremble as she gazed—a face which had
haunted her soul with a memory which would not
be shaken off, but which in darkness and in sorrow
had clung there as “the scent of roses hangs forever
around the vase which once preserved them.” It
was the face of Lord Dudley—the son of her father’s
enemy. The man whom she had loved with all the
truth and fervency of a pure and most affectionate
heart, but from whom she was separated forever.
Was it strange that her cheek and lips grew white or
that those heavy lashes drooped sorrowfully beneath
the look with which he regarded her? a look which
made her heart turn faint with the memories which
crowded upon it. She could not meet that glance
again. Her father, the highborn and persecuted,
was there, and yet that one look had made her
almost forgetful of his wrongs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before these thoughts could fairly pass through
her mind, and while the duchess hesitated at the door
that she might have time to gain something of composure,
the duke of Northumberland arose from
his seat with that air of graceful and proud courtesy
which no man could adopt with so much ease, and
crossing the room, gave his hand to the duchess,
inquired kindly after her health, and requested permission
to lead her before the king, who sat in his
large easy chair looking almost healthful, and made
quite happy in the newly aroused power of conferring
happiness upon others. Edward stood up to
receive the duchess, and when she would have
knelt, he took her hand in his and pressed it affectionately
to his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His Grace of Northumberland will bear witness
for us,” he said, “how ignorant we have been of
all that you have suffered, and how deeply the knowledge
grieved us when it did come. For our sake
let all be forgotten; if any power is left to our feeble
state, these persecutions shall not happen again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady, thus kindly addressed, made a grateful reply,
which was somewhat restrained by the presence
of Northumberland. He must have heard all that was
passing, though his face wore the same bland and
tranquil smile with which he had first approached her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After pressing his lips once more to the fair hand
in his, Edward turned to the Lady Jane, a smile
broke over his pale face, and those large eyes,
usually so regretful and sad in their expression,
now sparkled with pleasant feelings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And our sweet cousin,” he said, looking down
upon her lovely face as she sank to his knees, “methinks
the prison fare has added to a beauty which
was bright enough before. Nay, fair one, if you
must do us homage, another hand must raise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, Edward had extended his hand as if
to raise the young girl from his feet, but instead of
this he laid it among the rich tresses of her hair,
where it rested pale and caressingly lighted up by
his own princely gift of jewels, and sinking to his
seat again he bent forward and addressed the wondering
girl in a low and earnest voice, smiling as he
spoke, and faintly blushing as he saw that his words
made the warm color deepen and glow in the cheek
that had a moment before looked so cold and pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, do not rise yet,” he said, checking the
modest impulse which prompted the bewildered girl
to seek the shelter of her mother’s side, and as he
spoke, Edward lifted his eyes from the drooping
lashes that began to quiver upon the now red, now
pallid cheeks, and looked expressively toward Lord
Dudley, still keeping his hand upon the young creature’s
head. He felt her start and tremble beneath
his touch as Lord Dudley came eagerly forward, and
though she did not look up, he knew by the trembling
of her red lip and the rosy flood that deluged her
face and neck, that the music of that familiar footstep
had reached her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley returned the young monarch’s smile, as
his hand was removed from its beautiful resting
place, with a look of gratitude, and bending down
he whispered a few words to the Lady Jane as he
raised her from the king’s feet. She cast one timid
glance on his face; it was eloquent with happiness,
so eloquent that her eyes sought the floor again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king looked toward the ante-room and gave a
signal with his hand. It was obeyed by our favorite
page, who glided across the room and softly opened
a door leading to the royal oratory. There, within
the gleam of a silver sconce which flooded the little
room as with a stream of moonlight, stood the king’s
chaplain, in his sacerdotal robes, and with a book
open in his hand. Upon the marble step at his feet
lay two cushions of purple velvet fringed and starred
with silver. Lord Dudley led his trembling charge
forward, and they knelt down upon these cushions,
while King Edward and all within the outer room
stood up. A moment, and the deep solemn tones of
the chaplain, as he read the marriage ceremony,
filled the two apartments. The sweet face of Lady
Jane was uplifted, and the pure light fell upon it, as
she made her response in a voice rendered low by
intense feeling—another response, louder and more
firmly uttered—a benediction—and then Lord Dudley
led his bride from the oratory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your blessing, my father,” murmured the half
happy, half terrified young creature, as she knelt
with her lord at Somerset’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Somerset bent down, kissed the
beautiful forehead so bewitchingly uplifted, and
gave the blessing which made his child happy. The
duchess smiled, and wept amid her smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Jane,” she murmured, fondly putting back
the ringlets her own hand had arranged, “ah, Jane,
we little thought this evening would end so happily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The king stood by, and turned away to conceal the
pleasant tears which filled his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One thing more,” he said, “and our slumber
will be sweet to-night;” as he spoke, the royal youth
advanced to “The two Dukes,” where they stood
side by side, and linking their hands together, placed
his own upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be friends,” he said, “the kingdom has need of
you both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward felt their hands beneath his clasped together,
and was satisfied. He was young, full of
generous impulses, and believed that two ambitious
men toiling for the same object <span class='it'>could</span> be friends.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Zanoni, a Novel. By the Author of “Pelham,” “Rienzi,”
&amp;c. Two Volumes. Harper &amp; Brothers.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A few years ago, in the first volume of “The Monthly
Chronicle,” a tale, or rather the fragment of one, appeared,
professedly from the pen of Bulwer. But the story defied
critical as well as common sense to understand it. It
opened abruptly and closed abruptly. It had, properly
speaking, neither beginning nor end. It was incomprehensible.
By general consent, “Zicci” was regarded as a
freak of the author—its only merit was the novelty of having
no merit at all. After being the jest of the reviewers
for years, this story has been completed, and now lies before
us, under the altered name of “Zanoni.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of the novel is borrowed from the dreams of the
old Rosicrucians, and of the predecessors of that sect as
far back as the Chaldeans. These visionaries imagined
that man, by a rigid practice of virtue and the sublimation
of every earthly feeling, could attain to a perfect comprehension
of the most hidden secrets of nature—could hold
communion with, and exercise control over, the unseen
powers of the air—and could even preserve human life to
an indefinite extent, by acquiring the means by which it
might be perpetually renovated. The story opens at Naples,
towards the close of the last century. The hero is a
noble Chaldean, who, having attained to the knowledge of
this last secret of his sect while yet in the prime of youthful
manhood, wears now the same aspect as when he gazed
on the stars from his home in Assyria, before the temple
had been built on Mount Zion—before the Greeks had
fought at Marathon—before the builders of the pyramids
had died. To an imaginative mind, such a character possesses
peculiar charms. He comes before us with all the
solemnity of the past, making vivid to us the great deeds of
buried ages. He has seen the army of Alexander on the
Indus. He was in Egypt when Antony’s fleet set sail for
Actium. He remembers when Demosthenes thundered for
the crown, when Cæsar fell in the Senate House, when
Rome was sacked by Attila. For three thousand years he
has gazed on mankind with a face as unchanging as that
of the weird Sphinx of the desert. For ninety generations,
he has survived war, and pestilence, and the slow decay
of the system,—a being mysterious in his subtle power,
wonderful in his awful and majestic beauty. This exemption
from death he has won by the subjugation of every
feeling and passion to the mastery of a <span style='font-size:smaller'>PURE INTELLECT</span>.
But still retaining his <span class='it'>youth</span>, he retains the capacity to <span class='it'>love</span>;
and though, for such a lapse of ages, he has withstood
temptation, he is destined at last to yield to it. He meets
with and loves a beautiful Italian girl. He thus endangers
his earthly immortality; for the moment he yields to earthly
passion, however pure, his intellect becomes clouded, and
he loses the prophetic faculty as well as others of his high
attributes. Conscious of this, and knowing that he will
bring peril and sorrow around the path of Viola by linking
her fate with his, he struggles long against his passion, and
even after yielding to it, endeavors to avert from her head
the dangers which, as consequences of his conduct, thicken
around her. In this Titanic conflict betwixt the intellect
and the heart—in the alternation of the aspirations of the
one and the agonizing throes of the other, lies the <span class='it'>burden</span>—as
the old writers would call it—of the novel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea, as thus stated, is simply grand. It has a
unity that overpowers us. Had the author contented himself
with merely developing this idea, omitting every thing
which had no necessary bearing on the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>, he
would have produced an almost faultless story. But he
has, in a great measure, failed in carrying out his conception.
He has weakened the effect by diverging from the
<span class='it'>burden</span> of the story. As the novel has been circulated in
various cheap forms throughout the country, we shall take
it for granted that our readers have perused the book. This
will save us the necessity of recapitulating the plot as the
basis of our remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plot is grossly defective in several important particulars.
Many even of the leading incidents have no
bearing on the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>. The compact betwixt Zanoni
and the <span class='sc'>Evil Eye</span>, at Venice, is of this character. The
author’s original intention was to make the condition exacted
from the husband play a prominent part at the crisis;
but he subsequently changed his mind, and brought about
the <span class='it'>dénouement</span> by other means, forgetting, however, to
rewrite this scene, so as to adapt it to the altered aspect of
the story. The <span class='sc'>Evil Eye</span>, when he comes to assert his
rights, is cavalierly dismissed, in a very inartistical manner.
It would have contributed far more to the unity of effect of
which we have spoken, if the author had pursued his original
design, and made the condition exacted from Zanoni,
the sacrifice of his own life, when, at any future period, he
should wish again to preserve the life of Viola. By following
out this plan, Bulwer would have been saved the necessity
of introducing the sanguinary scenes of the French
Revolution; and the crisis would have been brought about
in a far more natural manner than it is at present. The
introduction of Robespierre and his associates is <span class='it'>forced</span>;
it renders involved an otherwise simple and effective plot.
We are astonished that an adept in Art, such as Bulwer
professes to be, should have committed a blunder for which,
if he had been a schoolboy, he should have been soundly
whipped. If he intended to enlist and keep up the interest
of his readers in his two chief characters, why has he distracted
the attention by the introduction of The Reign of
Terror, that most real of tragedies, whose horrors exceed
anything that romance can imagine, whose thrilling story
stops the pulsation of the heart for anything less terrible?
The mind should have been left undistracted to contemplate
the stern, Doric self-sacrifice of Zanoni! The author
should not have sacrificed the unity of effect for the dying
struggles of Robespierre, or any other human butcher in
the blood-bespattered shambles of Paris. We can see
what misled Bulwer. Not satisfied with the grandeur of
his original conception of the <span class='it'>dénouement</span>, he sought to increase
the interest by the clap-trap effect of rapidly shifting
the perilous incidents in which all the chief actors are
involved. This is a trick he has learned behind the foot-lights,
and not in the study of the great old masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are numerous minor errors in the plot. Glyndon’s
<span class='it'>liaison</span> with Floretta does not advance the story, and the
only part she plays in evolving the crisis, is the betrayal of
Viola at Paris. If the plot had been handled properly,
there would have been no necessity for her agency here.
But the desire to paint mere sensual love, in this character,
induced Bulwer to patch her into the tale. He has been
persuaded, from the same reason, to introduce other unimportant
characters we might name. In short, his motley
array of personages reminds us of Burke’s graphic picture
of Chatham’s last piebald ministry, where he compares it
to a piece of mosaic, “here a bit of black stone and there
a bit of white,” and humorously depicts the consternation
of men, who had been all their lives libelling each other,
on finding themselves “pigging together in the same
truckle-bed.” In like manner the robber figures in the
scene. So do Mervale and that worthy shrew his wife.
These are all gross faults; for the necessity of preserving
that oneness and entireness of effect, of which we have
spoken so much, exists in peculiar force in a highly imaginative
work like this. The introduction of supernal agents
is, at all times, a dangerous experiment; and, when they
are introduced, the illusion is to be kept up at every sacrifice.
This can scarcely be done where the reader listens
on one page to the converse of immortal powers, and on
the next to the wrangling of a cross, sleepy wife with a
drunken husband—when we are hurried from the lofty
aspirations of Menjour and Zanoni, to the silly love toying
betwixt Glyndon and Floretta. This brings us to another
error in the author—an error which lies at the very bottom
of all his errors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject is unfit for prose. It properly belongs to the
drama. The true province of the imagination is poetry,
and although this divine faculty may stoop to prose, it can
never truly shine but in the celestial garments of the muse.
We do not deny the impossibility of treating an ideal theme
in prose—we only assert the superior advantages which
poetry affords for the same object. Transitions may be
tolerated in the drama which should be anathematized in
prose. But, above all, poetry would favor the preservation
of the illusion to which we have already referred. The
<span class='it'>tone</span> of a story such as Zanoni is, could be better preserved
in poetry. The idea of the tale is inexpressibly grand, and
might have been worked out with terrible effect. The
struggle in Zanoni’s mind betwixt his love for Viola and
his longing for an earthly immortality would have produced,
if evolved by a master hand, a tragedy equal to Manfred,
Faust, we had almost said Prometheus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we have said enough under this head. Let us look
at the characters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Zanoni we have already spoken. His character belongs
to a lofty region of the ideal. The conception of
Pisani, also, is highly imaginative. He comes in, at the
opening of the tale, with the same effect with which a fine
overture precedes an opera. He prepares the mind, by his
unearthly music, for the mysteries that are to follow. His
barbican, his solitary life, his dreams of wild figures and
wilder music in the air, entitle him to a high rank in the
ideal. What a grand thought is that which represents him
at the theatre, mechanically performing his part, while all
the time his soul is thinking of his beloved opera, so that
often, unconsciously to himself, he bursts out into its weird
and startling music!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Viola, the impersonation of the purest love, unalloyed by
any sensual feeling—Glyndon, the weak, vacillating, yet
aspiring man—and Menjour, the embodiment of mere intellect,
apart from any influence of the heart, good or bad,
are well drawn characters—<span class='it'>of their kind</span>. Their fault is
that they have no individuality. All Bulwer’s personages
partake of this error. There is not, in his numerous novels,
a single personage whom we can look back on as on a real
individual. Falstaff and Nicol Jarvie are so life-like that
it seems as if we had drunk canary with the one, at the
Boar’s Head, and “had a crack” with the other, on the
causeway of Glasgow. Bulwer’s characters have none of
this personal identity—they are only embodiments of certain
passions or peculiarities. His actors are like the
knights of Spencer, mere stalking horses for particular
vices or virtues—or, like a wigmaker’s block, the representative
in turn of the heads of all his customers. Every
personage in Zanoni, without, as we remember, a <span class='it'>single</span>
exception, is thus ticketed for a particular vice or virtue,
like passengers in a railroad car. Now, we do not object
to the introduction of these personages if they are
necessary to the plot; but, for heaven’s sake, Mr. Bulwer,
give us something more than mere automatons! Don’t
ask us in to a second Mrs. Jarley’s wax-works!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have spoken, in terms of high praise, of the character
of Zanoni. We have, however, said that the theme
was more adapted for poetry than prose. Having chosen
prose, the author has erred in calling his book <span style='font-size:smaller'>A NOVEL</span>.
Let us be understood. Feeble as is the province of prose
to do justice to so ideal a character as Zanoni, we do not
base our present objection to the book on that ground. It
is one of the inalienable rights of man to show his ignorance,
to make a blunder, or in any other way to play the
fool. This is not the question now. The work before us
purports to be a novel, and nothing but a novel. It might
have been named a romance, a mystery, or the Lord knows
what! But it is put forth as a novel, under the <span class='it'>imprimatur</span>
of the writer of “<span class='sc'>Art in Fiction</span>,” of the man who sets up
to be the high priest of the synagogue! Is it such?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A novel, in the true acceptation of the name, is a picture
of real life. The plot may be involved, but it must not
transcend probability. The agencies introduced must belong
to real life. Such were Gil Blas and Tom Jones,
confessedly the two best novels extant. Whether the title
was properly applied, in the inception, is not the question.
Usage and common sense have affixed a definite meaning
to the word. When authors cease to paint real life they
cease to write novels. The tales may be very good of their
kind, but they are no more novels than a sirloin is a mutton
chop, or than Bulwer is the artist he pretends to be.
Judged by this standard, Zanoni is not a novel. There
are pictures of real life in it; but to paint society, <span class='it'>as it is</span>,
was only collateral to the chief aim of the work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We say nothing of the moral of the story; for all that is
truly noble in Bulwer’s imaginary doctrines of the Rosicrucians
is stolen from the pure precepts of our holy religion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The English of the author is neither better nor worse
than in his former novels. His language was always inflated,
often bombastic. He personifies as desperately as ever.
His allegories are as plentiful as Sancho Panza’s proverbs,
or as an old maid’s ailings. The same straining after effect,
the same attempts at fine writing which were such glaring
defects in his former novels, are here perceptible. Through
every line, the author looks out, eager, like Snug the joiner,
to tell you he is there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are many fine thoughts, nevertheless, in these volumes;
and, on the whole, the book is a valuable addition
to our imaginative literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we have dwelt longer on the faults than on the merits
of “Zanoni,” it is because the latter are more apparent to
the popular eye. We have dealt out, however, even-handed
justice to the book, since the province of a critic is
not that of the state advocate, who argues only on one
side, but rather that of the judge who sums up the case,
and of the jury who are sworn “a true verdict to give
according to the evidence.” With this remark, we leave
“Zanoni” to its fate.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Poets and Poetry of America, with an Historical Introduction.
By Rufus Willmot Griswold. One vol. Carey
&amp; Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is the best collection of the American Poets that
has yet been made, whether we consider its completeness,
its size, or the judgment displayed in its selections. The
volume is issued in a style commensurate with its literary
worth. The paper, type and printing are unexceptionable.
Messrs. Carey &amp; Hart have, in “The Poets and Poetry of
America,” published the finest volume of the season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The editor begins his selections of American Poets with
Frenau, prefacing them, however, with an historical introduction
evincing considerable research. In this introduction
he shows that, prior to the revolution, the pretenders to the
muse in the colonies scarcely rose to the level of versifiers.
From Frenau downwards, the chain is kept up to the
youngest poet of the day. About eighty-eight authors are
embraced in the body of the work. To the selections from
each author is prefixed a short but clear biography. The
editor has not always been guided, in making his selections,
by the relative merit of the various authors, but, in
cases where the writers have published editions of their
poems, he has been less copious in his extracts, than when
the poet has left his works to take care of themselves.
Thus we have the whole of Dana’s “Buccanier,” of Whittier’s
“Mogg Magone,” of Sprague’s “Curiosity,” and of
Drake’s “Culprit Fay.” Most of C. Fenno Hoffman’s songs
are also included in the collection. But Pierpoint’s “Airs
of Palestine,” are excluded, as are the longer and best
poems of Willis. At the end of the volume is an appendix, in
which about fifty writers, whom the editor has not thought
worthy of a place in the body of his book, figure under the
name of “Various Authors.” Such is the plan of the work.
A word, in detail, on its merits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have said that this volume is superior to any former
collection of the American Poets, whether we regard its
size, its completeness, or the taste displayed in the selections.
This is our <span class='it'>general</span> opinion of the book. We do
not, however, <span class='it'>always</span> coincide with the judgment of the
editor. There are several writers in the Appendix who
have as good claims to appear in the body of the work, as
others who figure largely in the latter more honorable station.
There are many mere versifiers included in the selection
who should have been excluded, or else others who have
been left out should have been admitted. Perhaps the
author, without being aware of it himself, has unduly
favored the writers of New England. Instances of all
these faults will be noticed by the reader, and we need not
further allude to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The editor has scarcely done justice to some of our
younger poets, either in his estimate of their genius, or in
his selections from their poems. A glaring instance of this
is the case of <span class='sc'>Lowell</span>, a young poet, to whom others than
ourselves have assigned a genius of the highest rank. We
would have been better pleased to have seen a more liberal
notice of his poems. We know that, with the exception of
“Rosaline,” better selections might have been made from
his works. A few years hence, Mr. Griswold himself will
be amazed that he assigned no more space to <span class='sc'>Lowell</span>
than to M’Lellan, Tuckerman, and others of “Οι Πολλοι.”
Holmes is another instance of the injustice done an author
by the editor’s selections. The author of “Old Ironsides”
has written better poems than that, all about the old man,
of whom</p>

the book, as a whole, is one of high merit; and, from the
very nature of the work, it is impossible for an editor to
produce a faultless volume. A thorough analysis of the
book might induce many, whose minds are not comprehensive,

our author is distinguished above all writers of sea-tales.
The two combats betwixt Sir Gervaise Oakes and the
French fleet are told with unusual power. But there is
nothing like character in the tale, and the plot is shamefully
commonplace. Mr. Cooper seems to be aware of his
want of ability to write a story, or paint a character, and
he therefore wisely expends his whole strength on particular
incidents and scenes. In his line he is without a rival
here or in Europe.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
